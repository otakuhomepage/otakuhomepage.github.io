<p>Jdrama is so amazing and entertaining. I forget which show got me into Jdramas. I'm thinking it was My Boss My Hero or Hotaru no Hikaru. Or was it Liar Game? No wait... Kurosagi?</p>
<p>Anyways, I've seen lots of JDramas over the times. And here I'll be writing about old &#47; new JDramas that are highly recommended. The thing about JDrama is that you get to learn more Japanese vocabulary because it's closer to everyday. Vs Anime where it's like Nanyate?! Insert random catchphrase dattebayo.</p>
