<p>I started watching Sherlock this past weekend on Netflix. The UK television series. I marathon watched the first three episodes. I was so stoked since there were 3 seasons available on Netflix, but then I realized that each season only had 3 episodes. Then again, considering the quality of the show... I'm not surprised that there's only 3 episodes per year. Each episode is almost like a mini movie of greatness.</p>
<p>I really want to write about the show and the plot but then it's kind of hard without spoiling you so I guess I'll avoid that. The show is set in the present day UK. So you see guns and smartphones. Sherlock Holmes is a genius consultant detective and his sidekick Doctor Watson is there so that Holmes gets to explain his genius thinking to the audience.</p>
<p>I liked how the show is adapted slightly differently from the novels much like the movies starring Robert Downey Jr. They made the Holmes in this movie way otaku and a total sociopath. Which for some reason I really enjoy. Maybe I'm secretly crazy. I did really enjoy Dexter and now Sherlock. =|</p>
<p>So some slight changes is that Holmes is a sociopath and he has decent... or rather he's not totally useless in combat. Watson is still very much the brawn of the duo I feel. I think that all the modern versions of Sherlock made both Holmes and Watson more action hero like because that's what the viewers like to see. It's like... without action even with all the crazy good plot... it might have not been as good.</p>
<p>The UK setting is georgeous. I've never been to the UK and it's definitely somewhere that I eventually want to visit. The camera work is good and it really has high production value I feel. The first episode reminded me of The Princess Bride. That might be a minor spoiler but... I have a feeling that most people wouldn't have seen Princess Bride. Since the movie was before my time... and I'm 25.</p>
<p>tl;dr - The UK adaptation of Sherlock Holmes is amazing. Sherlock is totally the Western otaku</p>
