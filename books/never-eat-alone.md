Kinda feeling lazy right now. So this is gonna be a placeholder commit.

I read and own the audiobook for Never Eat Alone. It's all about networking and keeping in touch with contacts and stuff. Seems kinda... redundant and basic. I don't think I learned anything from it. It's pretty much common sense. Don't be an asshole. Remember people and what they do etc. Keep in touch and reach out etc.

Whatever. I'll write a more in-depth review later.

***tl;dr - a book about networking. basic. not really recommended***
