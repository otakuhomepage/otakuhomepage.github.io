I recently finished my age of anxiety. You can get the book [here](http://amzn.to/1L3kn94).

The book was in a recommended list of philosophical books. I decided to read it because I've been feeling a little bit anxious recently. Reading this book had made me feel a lot better. First of all.. the author of this book is like... really messed up. Even moer messed up than me. He has this random fear of throwing up, he gets panic attacks flying on an airplane. While I get none of those. I actually think throwing up is kinda theurupeutic. Then again... the last time I threw up was because I ate so much food... and the time before that was when I overdosed on a maarjiuana brownie... kinda like how I'm on the cookie high now.

So the author makes you feel better about yourself since he has all these crazy fears that are probably worse than most people. Then he tells about the various treatments he's been getting as well as how the psychologists throughout the times thought of the mind body relationship. The different between it's a biological problem that can only be solved with drugs vs it's a mental problem that can be solved by thinking.

I think the biggest learning I learned from this book was that there is a certain mother type that raises kids with high attachment that don't show it. It's because they don't trust their mothers even though they want to be attached to them. It's sad because without the mother's attentikon.... when they grow up they have a fear of abandonment since they never had the affection they needed to form the base. I guess.. that describes me quite accurate. I never felt loved by my mother. When this girl told me her mother would take a bullet for her... I believed her... at the same time I knew that my mother would not take a bullet for me. It wasn't even a question of doubt. I guess... that's kinda depressing huh. I guess on one hand now I get to blame my issues on my mother and how I was mistreated as a kid. But as an adault even knowing this... I still unconsciously struggle. Sigh. THe damage to my unconscious.

So why should you read this book. I guess this book will make you feel better about yourself knowing that you aren't that crazy for your anxiety. That your anxiety is normal and to be expected. You'll also learn about all the various psychologies and beliefs of underlying issues and phobias. I unfortunately learned that my mother and overproective family cause me to become a high attachment person with trust issues. Which is why I can never form lasting relationships. 

**tl;dr - read this book to feel better about your anxiety**
