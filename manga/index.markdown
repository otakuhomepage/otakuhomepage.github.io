<p>I think Manga is quite a bit different from anime. I was originally introduced to Anime before manga. But then since anime is typically based on Manga... and me being the impatient person that I end - I typically end up just reading the manga once I've finished the anime in the case of an ongoing anime.</p>
<p>I think examples of manga that I've read because of this reason is Naruto&#47;Bleach&#47;One Piece&#47;HxH. Ouran High School Host Club and Vampire Knight as well. The thing is that I feel that Anime in general is a superior experience for the most part.</p>
<p>I think Anime is better because I don't have the mind to understand the action sequences properly when it's in manga. I feel that I simply skim manga for the plot content. In FMA, the battle **spoilers** between Al and the homologous and the exploding alchemist was soooooo epic. When I read the manga... I was like meh. Al is cool. But the anime... holy shit. I got nerd chills watching that battle. Al is such a badass in that scene.</p>
<p>So now you know why I prefer anime over manga almost all the time. The action and animation, along with the music makes the experience better I feel. That said, there have been many manga series that I've read without even bothering to watch the anime adaptations.</p>
<p>I'll be putting manga specific reviews into this section. One manga that I really wish was animated is tenjou tenge. I really enjoyed tenjou tenge even up to the point where shit got weird and didn't make sense. Same thing with History's Strongest Disciple: Kenichi. The **spoiler** fight between Hongo and Jeningzad. Shit, that is too amazing.</p>
<p>One thing funny about my manga reading is that with ongoing manga series I tend to forget where I am.. or if I've finished that series. I've actually read Vampire Knight twice. Because... I forgot that I read the ending. Same thing with Tenjou Tenge. I remember exactly where the anime ended despite not watching it for awhile... but I definitely read the manga at least twice before I remembered that I actually read the entire series.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - anime is better than manga for me. but I can't resist manga because of story reasons.</strong></p>
