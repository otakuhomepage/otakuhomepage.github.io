<p>This review will be based on the assumption that you've seen season 1. Else you should start with season 1 because Psychopass is freaking amazing. I'm not going to go over the Sybil System or the setting since it's essentially the same as season 1.</p>
<p>Season 2 starts off amazingly and as expected I guess. Inspector Ginoza is now an enforcer. He has a metal arm since he lost his arm. Akane has a cool stylish hairstyle and prefers to investigate in her own way. Her junior is totally useless. And, another anomaly is introduced as the villain.</p>
<p>I was really curious as to how the villain would work because if they just have a different Mashima with different motives... it's still the same and it feels like power rangers. Thankfully, season 2 gives us a whole new villain and gives us more intrigue and suspense.</p>
<p>I marathon watched the entire season one day. It's 12 episodes so ~4 hours long. And I watched it from 12 ~ 4am at night &#47; in the morning. It was suspenseful and I just *had* to know. So it's that type of show where information is carefully reveiled gradually and you never know what's gonna happen.</p>
<p>Well, sometimes you know what's gonna happen. But you can only predict the minor stuff. You can't really predict the overall plot, which is makes this show really entertaining. Besides the main antagonist... there's some really interesting characters that add to how great this show is.</p>
<p>One thing that I really am not a fan of... is how the inspectors have literally no close quarter combat experience. Like... how can you be an inspector without knowing some basic self defense? Various parts of the show with inspectors... was just so retarded in my opinion. Minor spoiler - like how the inspector loses her gun and gets beat by an old ass man with a stick. dafaq.</p>
<p>The Opening is by Ling Tosite Sigure again, and it's freaking awesome. I included it below because damn even though all his songs sound so similar... it's all so good. So good.</p>
