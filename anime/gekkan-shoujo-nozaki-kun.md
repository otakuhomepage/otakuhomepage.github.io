This took me awhile to get into. I didn't marathon watch this anime because it doesn't really have cliffhangers or even an overarching plot. It's kinda an episode by episode comedy series. I'd say it's 50% comedy, 30% school life and 20% romance. I was quite entertained by the anime. It's really funny and uh... Mikoshiba is probably the character I identify with the most.

Nozaki is the main character. Or one of the main characters of the anime. He's a manga artist that draws shoujo manga. And Sakura is the main character whose really chibi and really into Nozaki. She confesses to him and Nozaki thinks that she's a fan of his manga. And then recruits her as an assistant to help him with his manga.

The anime is mostly about school life. Each episode there's like a small arc or new character introduced. Nozaki uses things in his life as uh... inspiration for his manga protagonist. Mikoshiba is actually the female protagonist of his manga. Too jokes. 

***tl;dr - Funny entertaining school life manga. I'd recommend it. The big 3 characters are quite entertaining and important anime knowledge***
