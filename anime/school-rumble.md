<p>School Rumble is about high school life. It honestly makes Japanese High&nbsp; School look so much fun with all the clubs and activities. The main reason this anime is so amazing has to be the characters and of course the protagonist.</p>
<p>Harima Kenji is a delinquent not that smart, but a badass at fights and athletics. With no training he can go toe-to-toe with karate black belts and what not. He has godlike reflexes and his dream is to write his own manga. He has a crush on this airy klutzy girl whose the least attractive in the group and then there's plenty of adventures.</p>
<p>I think the best points of this anime is of course the great school life, and funny scenes. Harima Kenji vs Harry McKenzie. The opening and ending songs for this anime were also pretty good. Especially the second season. I don't think the plot for this type of story is that important, I guess you could say the plot moves forward and you always want to watch more.</p>
<p>One of my favorite characters in the anime is ojo~sama. The blond girl Eri Sawachika, for some reason I thought her name was Erika Sawajiri. Anyways Harima refers to her as ojo-sama because she's a wealthy princess? Shit, I forget what ojo sama means. I think it's a suffix for young rich girls or princesses etc. This anime has influenced to refer to people with an ojo~sama suffix jokingly. Like, Kenny-ojo sama. When people want me to refer to them with a -sama suffix.</p>
