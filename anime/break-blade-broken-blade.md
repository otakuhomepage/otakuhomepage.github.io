<p>So this weekend, or rather Saturday, I marathoned Break Blade aka Broken Blade. This anime was so damn cliche, yet I enjoyed it so much. This isn't a real series, it's more like a series of 6 movies. Each movie is 50 minutes long.</p>
<p>The first movie is like every single mecha &#47; gundam series that has ever existed. It was so cliche I almost felt... sick. Still though, I somehow enjoyed the first episode immensely. I guess if it ain't broke don't fix it? Or rather, the same story telling formula has worked for eternity. And if it works and is good... why change it?</p>
<p>You have our main character Rygart. He lives in a world where everyone can manipulate quartz kinetically like magic. But he can't... so he's basically handicapped. He went to school with the King and Queen and he gets invited back to the capital.</p>
<p>There is a war between nations and the war is fought using mechas. There's this newly discovered mech that no one can activate. It's so obvious that Rygart will become the pilot of this mysterious new mech. It's like all gundam series. You have a new amazing suit that's being built &#47; already exists. And then out of nowhere a random bystander becomes the pilot: see (gundam seed, gundam 00, valvrave, gurren lagann etc.)</p>
<p>Well, Rygart becomes the pilot. He's not trained for combat so he's clumsy and shit. And he's not built for violence because he's a pacifist. Blah Blah Blah. So cliche.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have Zess. He's the ultimate prodigy of war. He the academy he defeated 4 instructors single-handedly. He's on the opposing side for *some* reason. So it becomes a battle of the innocent vs the exceptional and of course between friends. Since Zess went to the academy with both the King, Queen, and Rygart.</p>
<p>For some reason... I really enjoyed this show despite the fact that it's cliche. You should watch it if you liked the aforementioned series. Valvrave, Gundam Seed, Gundam 00. I liked all those series so I guess this series was a natural fit for me. One of the characters is my favorite because of how overpowered he is.</p>
