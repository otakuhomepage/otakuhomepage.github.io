<p>Time for another round of comedy anime. Mitsumodomoe is retarded kid funny. Seto no Hanayome is... literally fish out of the water funny. It's like... Dwight Schrute funny.</p>
<p>It's been awhile since I've watched this and I'm writing purely out of memory... of which I have a goldfish memory. Anyways. This show is about a high school boy who is a dork and totally useless. Somehow he drowns in the ocean and is rescued by a super cute loli mermaid.</p>
<p>This mermaid is actually the ojo~sama of a yakuza clan of mermaids. So it's kinda like... Gokusen except the mermaid is younger but equally badass. Whenever she gets wet she transforms back into a mermaid with a tail.</p>
<p>Humans that are exposed to mermaids need to be executed. In order to keep the mermaid society a secret. But... she saved the useless protagonist's life... so it'd be weird to kill him right. Besides... then the whole premise of the show would be ruined.</p>
<p>So naturally... the mermaid and the useless dude get married. And then they start their married high school life together. It's a series of random funny events from start to finish. And of course the useless protagonist grows over the course of the series. But he still needs protection from the his yakuza bride of course.</p>
<p>There's a dere for this type of mermaid girl. But... I don't know it off the top of my head. I'm gonna guess Yandere and leave it at that. I remember watching this series and having a hilarious and good time. So much that I even watched the sequel.</p>
<p>You should watch this if you enjoy high school life anime, comedy, and romance anime I guess. I think it's less romance and more comedy though.</p>
