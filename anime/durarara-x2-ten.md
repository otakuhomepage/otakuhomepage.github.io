My first sentence became the tl;dr. So feel free to jump ahead. This entire season... it feels like there was no real... arching plot. Which is expected of the show I guess.

The positives are - you get more backstory into some of the characters. More characters get fleshed out. I think I may have forgotton what happens in season 1, but I didn't know that hmmm. Not going to write spoilers. But I didn't know that celty actually had a head. I always thought she was just the headless rider. Mind blown.

***tl;dr - Durarara feels kinda pointless... but it's also enjoyable to watch.***
