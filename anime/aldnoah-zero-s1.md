Hmmmmm. I watched this just because... my friend cosplayed as Slayne.

Uh... I didn't like it. There were no outstanding characters. The princess... was a horrible useless character. The battles were meh. The characters were just... crazy and stupid. Downvote. Do not watch.

***tl;dr - this anime sucks imo. My friend cosplayed as a character from this anime so I watched it... it sucks***
