<p>I'm inspired to write about Samurai Champloo because of the talent show at Kraken-con and how some guy did a dance &#47; wrap on Samurai Champloo. It's actually one of my favorite animes of all time. It's hard to quantify why it is so good though.</p>
<p>I don't actually remember much of the plot. I'm writing this purely from memory and I think the anime is possibly ~10 years old. I kinda feel old writing it. The two man characters are both uber badasses. Maybe that's why I enjoyed the show so much. I like it when the there are untouchable characters that are several magnitudes better than everyone else.</p>
<p>The show is about two samurai and this girl they are escorting I think. Mugen is a young and hot character. I guess I'd describe him as the 'Yang' samurai. He's hot headed, aggressive and a fight first ask questions later kind of guy. Which is cool. As previously mentioned he's an uber badass. His sword skills are amazing even though I don't think he has real training. He's just a beast. I don't even watch basketball... but I know that Mugen would be like LeBron James. He's just beast.</p>
<p>Then there's Jin. He's the 'Yin' Samurai. Cool, collection and with glasses. He wears glasses even though he doesn't need them. I guess he likes to show off his nerdy and literature side. Jin I think is the trained Samurai. His swordsmanship is based on efficiency and he's always calm and unemotional. I think between the two characters I like Jin better. Simply because... I guess I might naturally be a Jin? Or rather... I don't think you can train yourself to be a Mugen. Mugen is raw talent and beastiness. Whereas... Jin is all about finesse and skill. Jin is more Kobe. In real life... I like LeBron better because I think beast and raw ability is just so admirable because it's not something that you can really work towards. I guess I'm in awe of talent and so while I appreciate it... I personally don't have the raw talent so instead I rely on skill and finesse.</p>
<p>The 3rd character in the anime is this girl named Fuu. I think she's mostly there to balance out the two Samurai characters. Plus you always need a girl who needs to be helped in Japanese anime. &#47;shrug. I don't actually remember much about her... just that she's all cute and warm and stuff.</p>
<p>This anime is awesome because of the two badass samurais. You should watch it just so you know them. And of course... the show is highly rated. I personally really enjoy samurai based anime. I might go through and write all the samurai based anime that I've seen. Like... Samurai 7, Samurai Deeper Kyo, Kenshin, Basilisk.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - Samurai Champloo is an amazing anime featuring two badasses. Beast samurai and Finesse samurai with cute girl thrown in. You should watch it </strong></p>
