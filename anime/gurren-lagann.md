<p>The story starts out with Simon digging tunnels to expand his village. Simon and Kamina live in a village underground to hide from monsters. Humans have been living underground because monsters kill them when they try to move to the surface.</p>
<p>The village can only support so much population and eventually it's been decided that Kamina and Simon have to leave the village since they are a bad influence to the village. On the day of their scheduled departure, they get attacked and meet their future allies on the way to exploring the surface land.</p>
<p>This show is all about the growth of Simon as well as overcoming adversity. It's kind of typical shounen in a sense that there's always a bigger boss looming around the corner but there isn't really time for training. It's just through sheer determination and willpower that allows the people to proceed.</p>
<p>This story is amazing. I actually cried at one point of the series because it was so sad. I forget how to make the emote for crying because I haven't used it in so long. :'( ?</p>
<p>The anime is a mecha anime. The story and the action is extremely over the top and so satisfying. It's like such satisfying action, fight sequences and conflict resolution. The characters also are extremely realistic in a sense that they have a diverse range of characters from the super optimistic believers to the pessimistic people who believe in ruin and defeat.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that both the story and the character is amazing. The music is quite epic. Libera me is possibly one of the most motivating songs &#47; bgm that I listen to whenever I feel weak. Whenever I feel like I don't have what it takes, or that I can't do something I listen to it. Then I remember, impossible is nothing.</p>
<p>Watch this show and let me know what you think!</p>
<p><strong>"Don't believe in the you that believes in me and don't believe in the me that believes in you. Believe in the you that believes in yourself."</strong></p>
<p>Scoring: <strong>This show is all about overcoming adversity. And being manly. It's all about the growth mindset. Watch it!<br />
