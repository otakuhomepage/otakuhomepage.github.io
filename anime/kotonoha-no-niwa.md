<p>This is a movie by Makoto Shinkai. And I think this is his most best movie yet. Even better than 5 centimeters per second. 5 centimeters per second had better story and was more touching - but the animation in this movie is just so *gorgeous* as you can see in the screenshots above.</p>
<p>Aside from the beautiful visuals. The soundtrack of this movie is just so amazing. There are so many scenes where it's just the background music and visuals. This movie just gives you the feels through the visual and audio. Without even needing audio - you can feel what the director wants to convey.</p>
<p>The story revolves around a high school student who is interested in making shoes. He skips school whenever it rains to sketch his shoe designs and he ends up meeting a mysterious woman who is always there whenever he goes. Like 5 centimeters before it, this Shinkai film is very thematic in the ideas that it's trying to convey.</p>
<p>This movie blew my mind, possibly because it was the first movie that I watched on my brand new HDTV and how it was so beautiful. The themes also struck a chord I guess. Since the show is about a boy who can't find people who understands them. He designs shoes in isolation while the whole world just largely ignores him. I guess it parallels my situations where I work on things that people don't understand and I find it hard to meet people that I can genuinely connect with.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring &ndash; Watch this beautiful audio and visual masterpiece. You won't be disappointed.<br />
