<p>This anime is amazing. It's a must watch from me and the overall rating would be a 9.5&#47;10. The music opening &#47; ending for the most part is amazingly suitable for the show. It's dark and exciting. Now, for the actual synopsis &#47; review.</p>
<p>The show is set in the future where machines can read you psycho-pass which is a representation of your psychological state. It can assign you a crime co-efficient which will determine whether or not you will commit crimes. If your crime co-efficient is below the safe threshold, you are considered a harmless law abiding citizen. As people get stressed or get older or whatever, the crime co-efficient can rise and they become latent criminals that need rehabilitation or execution.</p>
<p>The show starts by introducing the newbie investigator Akane, she just graduated from school and is now an investigator. She is partnered up with a veteran investigator named Ginoza. The glasses dude I labelled above. Because inspectors have low crime co-efficient they cannot think like criminals or 'sense' criminals. That's why investigators are tasked with subordinates called 'enforcers'. Enforcers are latent criminals that work for the police. They have high crime co-efficients and they can be subdued by the dominators.</p>
<p>Right, the dominator. So the dominator is a gun that can instantly read a person's crime co-efficient. By pointing the dominator at a person, you get their crime co-efficient. If they are normal then the gun is locked, and if they are latent criminals they are either knocked out if they are in the low crime zone... or a target for extermination which means they get zapped by the dominator.</p>
<p>Watching the first episode again... I now see what they did. It should've been obvious but it actually escaped me. Which is the good old timeskip &#47; jump back. The opening song of the first episode is actually somewhere in the middle of the series timeline. Then they rewind the series up until that point... pretty neat stuff yo.</p>
<p>The show centers around the investigators capturing criminals and have the enforcers act as badasses. I think the reason that I really liked this show was because it was very plot driven. You had no idea what the villain was planning... or where the series is going. The villain in this series is simply amazing. Not going to spoiler, but let's just say you won't be disappointed by how badass the villain is.</p>
<p>I marathon-ed this series within 3 days. That's how good it is.</p>
<p>Scoring: <strong>Watch this shit.</strong></p>
