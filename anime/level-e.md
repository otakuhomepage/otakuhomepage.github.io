This is a gonna be a short review... because Level E is just a highly recommended anime from me. It's 13 episodes short... and each episode is bite sized goodness. It's from the same author as Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter X Hunter. And it's amazing gag comedy of the Japanese anime variety.

The anime is about aliens living on earth. It's kinda MIB before MIB actually happened. I think this is one of the few shows that captivated me within the first episode... from blank. Like this wasn't really recommended to me... I just randomly decided to watch this because I'm otaku. And it's just really really good.

**tl;dr - watch Level E! It's really funny.**
