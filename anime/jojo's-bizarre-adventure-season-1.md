This review will only cover the part 1 of the anime. Which was aired in 2012/2013 in two parts.

I've had Jojo downloaded for awhile. But I didn't get a chance to really get into it because the first few episodes were so... boring. Like... I couldn't really get engaged into the story. It kinda reminded me of Gurren Lagann in a sense that it took me awhile to get into. But Gurren Lagann is now one of my top 10 favorite anime of all time. I think... Jojo is almost in the same level of greatness. I don't think it's a top 10 for me... but I've seen way to much anime. It's still really *really* good.

Part one of the series follows the Joestar family living in the ancient times. Before airplanes I think. For some reason... all characters in the Joestar family start with a Jo* in their name. I think that's where the Jojo comes from. I.e. Jonathan Joestar -> JoJo. But anyways. The anime basically follows the Joestar family as they overcome crazy shit that they're 'destined' to face.

The thing that I most enjoyed about this anime of course is that the main Jo character always has an unstoppable will. Like Kamina / Simon from Gurren Lagann. I think... having an unstoppable will / indominable spirit is what makes a character amazingly interesting and leads them to become overpowered.

I think this anime is just good for enjoyment purposes. It's like... dynasty warriors goodness. Where... you gain enjoyment just from mindlessly crushing hordes of soldiers. In the same vein - I feel that Jojo anime is typical shounen in a sense that good always prevails. That's not to say they don't suffer from adversity and whatever.

***tl;dr - Jojo is just an enjoyable shounen action anime. It takes awhile to get into - but it's quite good and I really liked it***
