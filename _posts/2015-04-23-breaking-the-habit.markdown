<p>I think I missed two weeks of posting a post. The output from my script:</p>
<div>112 days, 0:27:34.116876<br />

<div>Wow. It's already been 30% of 2015. Pretty damn crazy. Almost a third of the year has gone by. Just as I was getting back into the habit of going to the gym... I slipped up because of sleep deprivation and randomness.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>For the past two weeks I've been consistently going to Yoga and Hip hop class so at least that's sticking. I think the reason that I'm struggling so much to maintain my workouts is that... my goals aren't in line. Work is just dominating all aspects of my life. At my old work place I could wake up at 10:30 and get to work by 10:45. Now I need to wake up at 9:45 to get to work by 10:45. Wow. Typing that.... I guess I'm really spoiled. But I need to wake up by 9:30 in order to make it to work by 10:30. And I think that one hour of sleep makes a huge difference. It kinda sounds like a bullshit excuse though.<&#47;div></p>

<div>I've been listening to motivational videos recently. There's this phrase... where it's like. You gotta want it more than you want sleep. But the thing is... it's always a marathon and not a sprint. And when you're sleep deprived you just suck at everything. &#47;shrug<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>I've been pretty consistent with trying out new things and doing time bending activities. Last weekend I froze my ass off in a BBQ in the Richmond. I guess living in the city gives me perfect weather and walking distance to everything. I'm living the treat yo-self lifestyle. I think it'll be hard to give it up... but I digress.<&#47;div></p>
