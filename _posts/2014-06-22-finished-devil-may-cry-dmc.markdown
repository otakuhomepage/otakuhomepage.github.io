<p>Total gameplay time was 10 hours according to the PS3, but with deaths and whatnot I think I probably spent 12 hours on the game.</p>
<p>I played the game on devil hunter and not nehilim difficulty. I'm tempted to play the son of sparda difficulty followed by dante must die difficulty to unlock infinite dante. Very tempted, but that'll be at least 20+ hours.</p>
<p>I feel like the dumbed down the regular version of the game... it feels quite a bit easier than I remembered it. Then again, I played on level 2 and not level 3. So son of sparda + dante must die must be way harder. Tempted to try, but probably won't.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the platform aspects of the game. They made the game 50% action and 50% platforming which was very annoying. I rather just have it be straightforward killing shit all the time, but that's probably a personal preference.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - dmc is one of the few games I finished in 2014. If you liked any of the first 4 DMCs, the reboot manages to keep most of the goodness alive.<&#47;strong></p>
