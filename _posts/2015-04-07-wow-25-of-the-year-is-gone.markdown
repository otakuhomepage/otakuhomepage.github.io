<div>Wow. a quarter of the year is gone. These past few weeks feel so wasted. I've been really stressed out and busy with work. The good thing is that I started working out again. I'm above level 0 strength. I'm at level 1 strength. My peak is level 5 strength though... so I'm still ways off.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>The thing that I wanted to write about today is something that I've noticed recently. It's that every action you take or don't take... ultimately affects everything else in your life. Every little thing matters. For this past two months when I got a Netflix subscription. All I would do when I got home is run something on Netflix and watch it. I watched 8 seasons of Friends, and 5 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>Watching the shows makes me less productive. I haven't been working on my side projects. I haven't been working out as much. I haven't been to Saturday yoga in over 4 weeks. Last weekend... I stayed home all week and ordered $100 worth of take out. It's because I could expense the food so I ordered so much junk food.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>I ate an entire pizza by myself. Two servings of pasta by myself. And lasagna. The lasagna was particularly delicious. I've been waiting and refreshing my google news feed for the Xperia M4 aqua non stop. I can't wait til the phone gets released so I can buy it.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>There's so much garbage going on in my life and my mind. From the obsession with buying stuff, to watching crap on Netflix. It's no surprise that other areas of my life are slipping. This week I'm going to reorganize my plans and my daily goals. I need to get back into meditation, exercising and reading. I haven't completed a single book in 2015. That's... mind blowing. I guess I'm just sucking so far.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div><strong>tl;dr - every little thing matters. pay attention to everything that you do and don't do.<&#47;strong><&#47;div></p>
