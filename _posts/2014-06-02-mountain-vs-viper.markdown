<p>Shit, this game of thrones episode was all I've been looking forward to this season. I really wanted to see the fight between Oberyn and the Mountain despite having read the book and knowing the ending.</p>
<p>I knew that the Viper was dominating and had the fight won before a momentary instant of utter stupidity. I honestly didn't think it was possibly as I was reading it because he fucking jumping impaled the dude. But, I guess the show made it believable.</p>
<p>I'm a bit bummed that we didn't get to see the viper announce his champion*ing of Tyrion in front of everyone. As well as the preparation where Tyrion gets to play with the spear and it's pretty much revealed that the SPOILER HERE -- lance is poisoned so the mountain is gonna die no matter what END SPOILER.</p>
<p>tl;dr - sad that the viper died. he was such an awesome character and fighter.</p>
