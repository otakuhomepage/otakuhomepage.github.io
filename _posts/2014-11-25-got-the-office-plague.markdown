<p>I officially got sick on Sunday of this week. I was just feeling like utter shit on Sunday. I ended up sleeping for most of the day to recover. Today, I went to work and my brain was kinda weak. Lucky for me Philz coffee made me somewhat functional.</p>
<p>Coffee is like the ultimate pancea. It honestly cures most of my sicknesses... or pretty much always makes me feel slightly better. I always think that I'm extremely mentally tough. You know... I'll keep trying until I win. I don't quit or give up etc etc.</p>
<p>But shit, when I'm sick I feel so weak. All I want to do is sleep and watch tv when I'm sick. Even though reading a book is essentially the same as watching TV. I wonder if scientists can measure mental fortitude yet.</p>
<p>Well... I guess I gotta go back to my yoga learnings. A lot of it is accepting your limits but still pushing yourself. I accept that when I'm sick my productivity will go way down and my willpower is therefore also lower. But I still wrote this article... and I tried to do some reading. So... good enough? Acceptance and struggles.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - sick. sickness > my mental toughness. I'm going to will myself back to health before thanksgiving<&#47;strong></p>
