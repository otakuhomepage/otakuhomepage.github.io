I was gonna write a weekly / thoughts and reflections on EDC 2016. But... I just watched game of thrones. The episode that missed while at EDC. And... holy fucking shit. Sick nerd chills. So fucking good. It's like.... damn. media/television can you bring the epic highs. Almost drug like.

***Tons of spoilers below obviously***

Well. Shit. We all knew Daenerys was a goddess. As in like... her rise to power and her storyline puts her into the goddess tier. And holy shit. Her horses, her dragons and the slaying of the two masters. MAN. That was picture perfect. I think this season because it's the first time that it's ahead of the show... I can finally be surprised and living in the present. Like... I need to pay attention to every line of dialogue. I have the volume turned to the max. It's that good.

The Daenerys plot line is so good. Now that she got her dragons, her horses, and her ships. She's a bigger khal than khal drogo. Mind blown. I think at this point she'll definite rule the five kingdoms and protect them from the white walkers. After all... her dragons will melt the white walkers without a doubt.

This episode was the usual 59 minutes. But it felt so much longer. The contents were so jam packed and juicy. I was like... shiet. It's like 3 normal episodes of content. I even forgot what happens next. Like... just the Daenerys part would've been a glorious episode for me.

Wow. The Jon Snow one on one fight proposal. That was pretty ballsy. I was thinking that Ramsay would accept and treachery to a win. But I guess even he wouldn't be stupid and risk losing a sure win battle. Watching the beginning... of freeing the brother. He was dead man. He was a dead man the second he landed into Ramsay's hands. No matter what.

And then Jon Snow tried to save his brother. Sigh. I was like.... what the fuck. Your brother is fucking dead. I guess... one on hand you almost always have to try. On the other hand... if you know you'll fail... would you still try?? That's the paradox. Trying to win when you know you have essentially zero chances. 

I guess real life isn't really like fiction in that regard. It's rare that you're actually put into that position. Only in stories and fiction is such a thing guaranteed. Which brings me to my next point... I think emotions is generally bad. I mean... emotion / animal / non logic is good from time to time. Like the sword fighting... that's almost all based on muscle memory and emotion. I guess in that case emotion would somewhat make you a better fighter by giving you adrenaline. But from a logical perspective... charging into the army was suicide. And he performed suicide because... he was emotional. 

Oh shit. let's cut back. Sansa... telling Ramsay that he would be dead come morning. What. The. Fuck. That was so badass. It was a pretty bold prediction. And the ultimate mike drop moment. The whole time I was watching the fight I was thinking... oh shit. Jon Snow is gonna lose cause he's an idiot. And then the LOTR moment when Sansa shows up. Wow. Mind blown. So fucking good. Just so fucking good.

And then chasing down Ramsay into his castle. What the fuck. That was badass and crazy. This is literature so I guess you can't really approach it purely from a logical perspective. After breaching the walls... I thought Jon Snow would be crazy to accept a 1-1 fight. I mean... he had it won. But he still made it a 1-1 fight... and it was a shield against the arrow. That was pretty damn badass. The entire fight... when he got mount and was raining down punches. I was expected a cheap knife to happen. But then Jon Snow just beat the living shit outta Ramsay. That was pretty satisfying.

One thing I learned about EDC and the music that I like. Is that I'm actually mainstream. I've been sold man. I've been sold. I mean... all your beliefs and likes and idealogy was learned. You learned from society, the world, your parents, literature... whatever. To become who you are. And I guess... I've learned to enjoy karma. The villain getting the death penalty... or the good guys winning. That's all stories and literature right? The good guy overcomes obstacles and villains to win. Even though in real life villains rule and live prosperously. Then again... over a long timeline... all humans die so I guess all villains do die. Like all humans die.

Oh man. That ending. When Sansa feeds Ramsay to the hounds. It was... picture perfect. It's just like... justice is restored and life is good. Real life isn't like that though and I've come to accept it. But in fiction... damn. That shit is gold. That shit is gold. This is probably the best episode of all time. My mind is just blown. So much goodness happened in this episode. I'm kinda worried that shit will just happen like in real life and Jon Snow will die again or something. =/

Anyways. I've been sold on the karmic justice in fiction. I even wish that was the case in real life even though I know that's not the case.

***tl;dr - This was THE episode. Probably the best episode of all time in game of thrones. So much enjoyment. Goodness prevails and life is good again.***
