Man. It's like... they purposefully make it retardedly hard to assemble just to save a few cents of manufacturing. It's so dumb. I'm building my bed... and you need to perfectly align the rods. There's like 20 of them along the length of the bed. You get one in and 3 pops out. Blargh. Sigh. I should've just bought a preassembled bed. 

9 hours of struggle. I spent the entire day building my bed. I kept realizing I made mistakes later and later and I would have to undo everything. Sigh. Software is so much easier than hardware.

Post Completion day after - I had this rant written... cause I was really frustrated but I generally don't enjoy ranting cause it's not really productive. I wish that people that make furniture just made it easier to build. Instead of easier to manufacture. Ease of assembling makes a huge difference. 

Anyways. My bed had a malformed part. It couldn't be built and I had to apply some smart hacking. Basically there are so missing bars in the support because they didn't engineer robustness or redundancy in the design.

I just went to nitori and got another mat. My bed is now complete. It feels quite comfortable. I'm currently sitting in my 1LDK listening to music while reading a book. Life is good.
