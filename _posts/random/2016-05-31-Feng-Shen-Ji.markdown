I just wanna read about one of my favorite manhua of all time. Feng Shen Ji. It's so good. The storytelling is so cliche... and it follows all the patterns of manga/comics. But it's *still* so good.

It starts by laying down the foundations of the world. You meet the gods that rule over humans. And you see a great fight between the king + phoenix against the great gods. But then Tian descends and just rules with an iron fist. You have a kid of the king that has to live undercover and train. Of course he has divine backgrounds - he's the chosen one. So he's part god / part human. 

What is below will contain spoilers. Since... I just wanna explain why the manga is so good.

He gains divine power. Then he gets trained by his uncle - the #1 swordsman in the world in the art of smelting aura. Then he inherits soul powers from the #1 dark one. With just one of the 3 powers alone... god/smelting/soul is enough to reach the uber top tier... he of course achieves top tier in all 3. And then he even gains the power of nothingness. It's like... the best powers just fall into his lap.

I think my favorite character is actually the uncle. White hair and number one swordsman in the world. When I read the fight on the mountain it was just. Omg. Zi Yu is such a badass. 

I think one of the goodness of the manga is that the powers were well thought out. You have divine power, soul power, smelting aura, mantra and within each of those broad categories you had specializations that made each power unique.
