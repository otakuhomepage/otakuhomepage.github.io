I've always wanted to write a post on Hisoka vs Netero since HxH is one of my favorite animes. Ever since the hunter arc when Hisoka was like god tier... and even at the battle tower arc you never see Hisoka break a sweat. Everyone he meets is less than 100 which means he's essentially unbeatable.

In my opinion Netero would just stomp / crush the shit outta Hisoka. Because Hisoka cannot possibly move faster than the ant king and thus he'll have to tank the shots. And there's no way he has the durability of the king either. I don't think zero would even be necessary to stomp him. But in the worse case I'm pretty sure zero is unblockable / definitely overkill. 

***tl;dr - Netero would roflstomp Hisoka no sweat***
