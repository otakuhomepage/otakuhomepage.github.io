I just finished watching DBZ resurrection F. I disliked 80% of the movie... but the 20% of it. It was the usual shonen goodness. Which is to say... sooo good. 

Why did I dislike 80% of it? So much of it was... pointless and wasted exposition. Resurrecting Freeza and stuff. And then the other thing was there was the fight amongst the goons. And also freeze is a weak ass villain. It's like... Krillin and Android 18 individually would beat up freeza with ease. And then... you have Gohan struggling to beat fodder. Sigh. It's just... it makes everyone else look pitifully weak when that shouldn't be the case. I guess they did want to make Freeza seem like a badass... but the way that the people struggled against small fry. I didn't enjoy that at all. In my mind I was expecting Krillin to solo all the small fry. I guess they wanted to showcase the characters. But like... Piccolo struggling to beat a special soldier?! Piccolo should stomp freeza in like one move considering the way he whooped cell before cell got boosted. Then he trained in the hyperbolic time chamber after too. Sigh. I guess everyone just got way way way way way weaker. Maybe.

The good thing is. Seeing goku in action is just so satisfying. I never got why Goku was always the main character... I kinda wished Vegeta had more screen time but whatever. It was mostly just fan service I guess. Seeing more of the god super saiyan and stuff. I can't say that I really enjoyed it... but it was a decent break I guess.
