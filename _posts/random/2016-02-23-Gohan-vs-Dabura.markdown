You know what I felt totally robbed of? Gohan crushing Dabura.

I'm fairly certain that Dabura < Cell < Kid Gohan. So the question because where does adult gohan fit into the equation?

We know that Adult Gohan < Kid Gohan which is sad. I think Gohan actually lost the ability to turn SSJ2 at will when he became an adult. But my theory is that Dabura = Adult SSJ Gohan < Cell < SSJ2 Adult Gohan < SSJ2 Kid Gohan.

Moral of the story. If you ain't getting stronger you're getting weaker.

Also... Adult Gohan would've beat Dabura eventually.
