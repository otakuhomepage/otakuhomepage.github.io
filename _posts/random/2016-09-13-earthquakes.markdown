Wow. I just experienced a quake in Tokyo. It was small but noticeable. Reminds me of the big quake I experienced once in SF at like 2am... when I was playing video games and everyone was asleep. Shit. I hope Tokyo doesn't get the big quake in the 1.5 years that I'll be here. But hmm... maybe living long term in Japan isn't such a good idea. Then again... statistically speaking. 200k dead outta 30 million. I like my odds. o.o

It's weird that I moved from one big quake location to another. I guess earthquakes are my thing. I guess that's one of the great things about Toronto. No quakes or tsunami risk. Hmmm. New York also has quake and tsunami risk. O.O. I'm scared for future me even though quakes haven't happened yet. Plus I learned that I should have a earth quake kit... and learn Japanese so I can talk to people and figure out where the quake shelter is.
