Everyday I'm shuffling. Omg. I learned this new spin move. It's pretty neat. And I've been doing crazy intense shit with dynamodb at work. Life is good. I think I'm starting to appreciate and be more thankful about things in general. Hunter X Hunter resuming just blew my mind. And last weeks chapter... when we went to back Heaven's Arena with Hisoka and Chrollo. Deng. So good.

I think it's gonna be either a Hisoka victory or a draw. I'm gonna say it's gonna be a Hisoka victory. The reason being that Hisoka hasn't ever fought to his full strength. I think he has a tendency to fight with his abilities slightly higher than his opponent.... like how cell limited his powers vs goku. That way it's more exciting to him and he lives on the edge. Also, I think that danchou's role in the series is pretty much over. I mean... he was the villain and stuff. But going forward I don't see him interacting with Gon or even Kurapica. So from a plot perspective... Danchou is worth less than Hisoka.

Personally I think it's really hard to choose since both characters are so amazing. I can see how feats wise that Chrollo fighting on par with 2 zoldycks was impressive. I think both sides weren't really trying so that doesn't really count. Mind and heart both say Hisoka. Gg Chrollo.
