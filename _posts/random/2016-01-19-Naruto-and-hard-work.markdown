I think Naruto is like... the same level of luck / birth / destiny / nepotism as Yang Guo from Condor Heroes.

First of all... Naruto says that anyone can become hokage through hard work and whatever. But that's totally not the case... he's the protagonist of the series and he was born / gifted into uber lucky situations.

First of all. Aside from the fact that he's the 4th's son and he has the gift of kyuubi and whatever sage chakra blood that's in him.

He got Kakashi as his Jounin. Kakashi is like the top tier of Konoha and he even becomes temporary hokage. He basically trained under someone who was the hokage. Then he trains under the legendary Jiraiya. Jiraiya is the teacher of the 4th hokage. He was trained by essentially two of the best/strongest ninjas in Konoha / Za World.

He's one of 9 people to be a jinchuuri. And he gots the strongest one to boot. Too lazy to write more. Basically Naruto didn't become hokage through hard work. He was born into prestiege and trained by the best. I think Japan and Asian culture in general have more... bloodlines / nepotism so it's reflected in the media. I mean.. they have the longest line of royalty / monarch.
