<p>Too jokes. Today the funniest thing happened. So we were interviewing this Engineer and part of the interview process is just having lunch with the regular engineers. So when it was my turn to introduce myself - I said "Hi, I'm Han". Then I laughed because I'm not Han. It's just super funny because Han is one of the engineers on the team and everyone at the table was laughing.</p>
<p>I blame it on my fevered and delirious sick state. So what happened was she shook hands with Henry and then I saw hand. I think my brain was thinking Hand -> Han. Hi, I'm Hand -> Han. Anyways, it was a really weird experience because I knew I done goofed the second I said it.</p>
<p>Of course, me being the logical and guy with interest in psychology.. time to dig into this. My first takeaway is that... Introducing myself - for me is still a conscious activity. =_=. Despite being fevered and delirious I was able to code and deliver features. Programming takes less conscious effort than introducing myself. o.O</p>
<p>As to why I chose to use Han. I'm gonna go with Hand -> Han. I think I was gonna say Hi, I'm Hand. But then it auto-corrected to the nearest name. &#47;shrug. Too jokes... I don't unconsciously know who I am? Who am I? (kingdom hearts reference).&nbsp; Well, the good thing is that I wasn't feeling nervous or anxious even after that. I guess that's the upside... no more anxiety even when I mis-introduce myself.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - I can code unconsciously but I can't introduce myself unconsciously. SAP meme?<&#47;strong></p>
