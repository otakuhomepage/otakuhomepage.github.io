<p>I just had lunch with my mom and sister. Spending time with my mother hurts my brain because her way of thinking is so bad. All she does is complain about life and how the world is out to get her. Nothing in life ever goes her way and she never tries to do anything about it. Her way of thinking is my life sucks and I'm not going to try and make it better. =_=</p>
<p>I bought my sister a $70 laptop bag for her macbook air. It's her belated birthday present. So she's in debt from her student loans, and she would rather buy a laptop bag from a store than order it online for cheaper. Instant gratification tax... and she's like yup. totally worth it. =_=. Then she goes and buys herself a $25 pair of earrings. Yeah, I'm already in debt so I buy myself things because.. debt, you know. Blargh. I can't believe I'm related to these people.</p>
<p>It's been exactly 6 days since I came back to Toronto and I'm already all family'd out. I guess now I remember why I had to move away from home in the first place. For the longest time I've had this dream... and while I was living at home it ways always a dream that I had no way of realizing. I couldn't even picture myself doing it. When I moved away from home, I finally could envision it happening. I could see myself becoming the person that I 'dreamed' of.</p>
<p>I guess I have too much stuff in Canada. I've actually acquired more stuff that I need in SF... so I should stop buying random shit and start selling some of my stuff. I think the minimalistic lifestyle is the best after all. It does become true that the stuff that you have end up owning you instead of the other way around. I guess that's why I wouldn't ever want to take a mortgage on a house because then I'd be a slave to debt.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - your way of thinking shapes who you are. surround yourself with positive people<&#47;strong></p>
