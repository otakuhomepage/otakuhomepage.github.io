<p>Growing up I was forced to learn piano as a kid. I hated learning piano as a kid. I was forced to practice piano for 30 minutes a day and then it eventually raised to an hour a day. An hour a day of forced practice. Sometimes it would be 2 hours per day as I was nearing exams. I really hated all aspects of learning piano growing up. The constant criticisms of not working hard enough and being forced to do shit that I didn't want to do.</p>
<p>I guess that's why I've placed so much emphasis on the price of freedom. Maybe I'm just trying to relive my childhood now that I have complete freedom. I guess that's why so many adults go to Disneyland and buy model toys to build. I really didn't like being forced to learn songs that sounded bad.</p>
<p>I guess it's interesting though because now that I'm interested in learning how to play the guitar. I'm learning it completely without supervision and essentially hacking it. Learning how to play the most popular chords and then learning random songs. Rather than learning the basics and then building on. I feel that if I keep up the guitar learning I'll probably end up better - but I digress.</p>
<p>Recently I've been listening to more music on my beautiful Sennheiser 598. It really makes me appreciate the various instruments. Now I have newfound respect for the violin, guitar and piano. I actually really want to play the piano now because there are so many good songs that I would want to be able to play and listen to.</p>
<p>I'm actually tempted to buy an electronic piano off amazon for $400. But then it feels like a waste of space because my studio is really small here in San Francisco. I already don't have enough space for the regular use stuff that I have. Maybe I should just find a university that has a piano that I could then go to practice. Hmmm.... I wonder if AAU has a piano faculty.</p>
<p>I guess I'm just surprised that I actually want to play the piano. Of all the years that I've lived with a piano and grown up with a piano - I haven't once felt like playing the piano on my own. And now that I'm all alone and don't got a piano... I suddenly want to play piano. Weird.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - music is awesome on Sennheiser 598. and there are so many songs I want to play on the piano<&#47;strong></p>
