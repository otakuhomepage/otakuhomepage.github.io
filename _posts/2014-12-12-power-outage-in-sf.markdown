<p>So I woke up today and I was working from home because of the storm. Then my power went out around 9:30am. Lucky for me my cellphone, laptop and tablet was charged. I tethered internet from my cellphone and then I was good to start working on my laptop.</p>
<p>Technology is so marvelous. There's almost no way that I would've imagined being able to work remotely when the power is out. Tethering from a cellphone gives me 3M of internet, which is faster than what I use to use to download anime. I used to only have 1M which let me download at a fast speed of 128 kb &#47;s. Good old days. My Macbook pro actually lasted a surprising amount of time. I was using it from 10am til about 4pm. That's 6 hours of solid use. I was running vagrant, and cranking through test cases and what not. I had a bunch of programs open and stuff and it still lasted 6 hours.</p>
<p>The strange thing that I wanted to write about was towards the end of the day... at around 4pm when my juice was running low. I was somehow really scared. I don't know why. It's like how I read about people being scared to be disconnected from the internet. People always say that you should disconnect when you're on vacation and stuff. I was just really scared that electricity was not going to come back on for multiple days. It's not like I would starve or anything.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that without electricity I can't really function at all. Or rather, there isn't much for me to do besides sleep and meditate. It was dark out and there was no light indoors without electricity. Without electricity I can't read books on my tablet, play video games or code. I can't even plan and just write stuff on my book because it's pitch black. But still - I don't know why I was feeling fear. It was scary. I guess I'm scared of the dark.</p>
<p>I guess electricity is a necessity of my life now. Much like food and water. I don't think I'd function very well without electricity. I guess I wouldn't be able to caveman it up. Or would I? I guess if it was caveman or die I'd be able to survive. Don't even know why I'm writing at this point. Electricity is back so it's time to do some reading &#47; video games.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - no electricity scares me.<&#47;strong></p>
