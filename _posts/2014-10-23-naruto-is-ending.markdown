<p>I still can't believe that Naruto is ending. On one hand... I've wanted it to end for awhile. Ever since Itachi turned good I was sad. After all, he was the perfect villain. I'm not really a fan of Naruto (the character) and so I guess I didn't like how the focus of the manga was all Naruto and it got boring for me.</p>
<p>It's kind of crazy though. The manga has been going on since 1999... so it's been going on for 15 years. It's been&nbsp; a constant in my life - every Wednesday&#47;Thursday I'd look forward to the big 3 of bleach &#47; one piece &#47; naruto. And now Toriko.</p>
<p>Naruto has so much nostalgic value to me. The chuunin exam arc is possibly my favorite arc of all time. Lee taking of the weights... still losing to Gaara. And then Neji losing to Naruto. whoops spoilers. meh.</p>
<p>I think the beginning was just really fun because you got to see them grow and at the same time the ninja world was growing too. You slowly got introduced to more and more uber ninjas. But then when Naruto reached the god tier level... it just kinda became lame for me.</p>
<p>I remember as a kid reading up on theories of Naruto...&nbsp; there was this theory of tobi being Obito &#47; the 4th. I guess the theorizers were right. I was really depressed how the 4th isn't unstoppable SS tier since that's how they depicted him.</p>
<p>In the past... I couldn't wait for the future to come. And I guess... now that the future has arrived. I kinda wish it didn't. Maybe this is more about just enjoying every chapter and living in the present. Well. I guess I should stop bashing Sasuke and Naruto and just enjoy the last couple of chapters.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - I feel old and nostalgic now that Naruto is ending<&#47;strong></p>
