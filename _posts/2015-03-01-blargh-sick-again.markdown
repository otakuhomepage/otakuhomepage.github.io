<p>Fuck. I'm sick. I got the flu... along with intense backpain.</p>
<p>Sigh, when I'm healthy I always abuse my body thinking that I'm indestructible. And when I'm sick... I promise my future self that I'll always sleep properly, and rest properly and eat properly. But then... I don't.</p>
<p>I stopped writing for awhile because of the concussion and relapsing into laziness. And now I am deathly sick. How can the flu come with intense backpain. That's so fucking unfair. Fucking bullshit. Blargh.</p>
<p>The time bending this week was a dinner party with coworker. It was fun. I want to write more about what I learned and stuff, but back pain. Fuck this shit. BLARGH.</p>
<p>tl;dr - flu brings back pain. fucking retarded.</p>
