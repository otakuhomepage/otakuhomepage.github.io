<p>OMG. Hunter x Hunter Manga hiatus is over. Too crazy. My mind is blown. No idea how the story will advance, but I really want to find out with happened between Danchou and Hisoka. HxH is my favorite manga possibly because it's honestly unconventional and there's generally no uber power jump.</p>
<p>HxH manga reminds me of Charlie and the football. I must not get my hopes up.</p>
