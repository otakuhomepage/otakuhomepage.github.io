<p>went to see x men movie with my friends. the movie came out yesterday so it was packed. had to sit in the second row. bleh. overall movie was okay.</p>
<p>then after movie we decided to get food. we stopped at donut place. and got 8 donuts. i ate probably 5 donuts.</p>
<p>went to mel's diner. i ordered a strawberry shortcake. then a cheesecake. i feel like my blood is mostly sugar right now. i'm like near puke levels.</p>
<p>i wanted to write something thought provoking. about how too much of a good thing is bad. or how when you get what you fantasized - lots of sugar and cake. it isn't as good as you imagined it. i imagined enjoying every second of the sugar binge. but honestly, it started sucking about halfway through. i blame nanting. should not have gotten cheesecake after donuts and shortcut.</p>
<p>heavenly sword just arrived. it's something that i've always wanted to play. i hope it doesn't turn out like the cheesecake. gonna start playing it now at 2am in the morning because... im having an uber sugar high. and why not? might as well start some heavenly sword.</p>
