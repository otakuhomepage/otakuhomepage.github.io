<p>Today I visited UC Berkeley. School didn't start yet so it was mostly empty. The UC Berkeley campus is so nice. It's much nicer than the University of Waterloo. Sometimes, I wish I were American so I could've had the chance to go to MIT&#47;Harvard&#47;Stanford&#47;UC Berkeley. I've never actually visited MIT or Harvard but I'm sure they are both better than the University of Waterloo which I see as a farmland.</p>
<p>I still remember me and my friends waiting for the Burger King opening in Waterloo. Burger King was one of the top 3 food places at the University of Waterloo campus. Kinda depressing. Then again, I think that my imaginary American university life would be pretty much that same as the one I had where I ended up skipping class 75% of the time and barely passing all my courses.</p>
<p>I got to work at the UC Berkeley library today and I finally get my Android development environment set up for work. Now if I want to, I can work on the Android app in addition to the web&#47;api work I've already been doing. I was going to start writing some unit tests because testing is good.</p>
<p>I watched the ted talk on time bending yesterday. And I think I bent time a little today by going to UC Berkeley. I also woke up before 11am which is the first since starting my vacation. The last day of vacation is tomorrow so I'm kinda sad, but I'm also looking forward to going back to work.</p>
<p>Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut on Steam has a game breaking bug so I can't progress forward and my most recent uncorrupted save is 10+ hours behind so I guess I ain't going to be finishing that game. Of the 3 games I planned to play the vacation I ended up finishing none. Well, I still have the possibility of finishing Portal 2. I think Eidos &#47; Square Enix should be fined for releasing a game that cannot be completed. I wish I could demand a refund but it's honestly too much work. It's more about the principle. They released an incomplete and shitty product. Ugh. I bought FF13 on Steam and it also is buggy and laggy as hell. I feel that gaming software quality has gone way done since you can release an incomplete product and then 'patch' it. But then since you already have the customer's money you end up not doing shit and the customer just suffers. Blargh.</p>
<p>There is a ShareTea right next to UC Berkeley. My mind is blown. I'm going to to plan on writing every day into daily in order to ensure that I do a time bending activity. And also just to write more so that I improve as a writer. I've been reading randomc recently and stilts from randomc and his reviews of anime is so articulate and good. He's concise yet he manages to write a couple of paragraphs full of substance. My reviews of anime of jdrama have essentially been OMG this shit is awesome you should watch it. x3 paragraphs. O.O</p>
<p>I guess my 2015 goal for this blog is to write daily. And not give a shit.</p>
