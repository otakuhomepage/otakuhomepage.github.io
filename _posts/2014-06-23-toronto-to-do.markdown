<p>I already feel all Toronto'd out. So today I'm just going to write a big to-do list to make sure I get to it in my remaining time at Toronto.</p>
<p>I'm only in Toronto for another 6 days from today, so I think it's cool that I just take it easy on the exercise. I guess this will be a 3 week break from working out, I'll probably get weaker but I guess its cool to just take a break from time to time. In the words of a book that I read, f**k it. No need to eat healthy all the time, just take a true vacation.</p>
<p>I want to go out for afternoon tea every afternoon since I need to be coding anyways. I'll wake up and code and go out to cafe and write code in order to do work.</p>
<p>Looking at my room and house, there's just so much garbage that I don't want in my place. I have clothes from when I was 12 just sitting in my bedroom closet. I'm going to clean out all my closet and just donate all my shit. There's probably thousands of dollars worth of clothes that I've accumulated over the years, but now it's totally unnecessary. It's like the sweater that I wear once a year, or those 13 year old pants that I won't be able to fit into.</p>
<p>There's this huge stuffed animal in my room. There's also the senmitsu arcade stick parts that I ordered and spent $100 on in order to build my own arcade stick. So much junk is in my room and in my life. Junk that I don't need and it's time for me to purge it.</p>
<p>I'm planning on living with my grandparents for a few days. One of the primary reasons for me visiting to toronto was to spend time with them.</p>
<p>I still need to do my taxes, I'm hoping that my friend will take care of that for me. I want to spend time and see some of my friends that I haven't seen in awhile. Specifically, Mark, Willy, Cassie, Terry and Tak.</p>
<p>Besides spending time with grandparents and friends, going to try and get some reading done. and writing. There's so many pages that I've been meaning to write... I'll jot down the key idea on my cell phone but never get around to writing the full post. So time to write that.</p>
<ul>
<li>taxes<&#47;li>
<li>minimalism (1 garbage bag of shit thrown out per day)<&#47;li>
<li>grandparents<&#47;li>
<li>friends<&#47;li>
<li>reading + writing<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
