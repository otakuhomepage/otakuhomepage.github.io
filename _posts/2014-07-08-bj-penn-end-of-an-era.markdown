<p>I was just exercising at spin class when this thought popped into my head. I'm almost 25 which means I'm basically at my physical peak. That's kind of scary but at the same time super exciting. Sometimes I feel like I'm not pushing myself, almost like I'm wasting my talent. I could be doing so much more... and yet I'm content with a stable job and the otaku + gaming life.</p>
<p>I was wondering about how BJ Penn felt now... do you think he regrets squandering his talent? I mean, as I fan I'm really disappointed that he even went and competed at welterweight... and I feel that for the Edgar fights I and II he wasn't really fully prepared. If we had the BJ Penn that destroyed Kenny Florian and Diego Sanchez... damn. I mean, BJ is like the ultimate badass.. but he didn't always train to his best abilities.</p>
<p>Am I just lazying? Can I afford to just do the same thing for another year or two? They say limits are only limits when you acknowledge them... I guess I shouldn't limit myself. Looking back 10 years... hmmm maybe I should jot down the regrets I had over the past 10 years and make sure it doesn't happen for the future. That'll be the work of a page. But for now... I'd like to try and link BJ Penn squandering his talent to myself. I personally don't think I'm... nah bullshit. I could be doing so much more. I keep making excuses like I invest to much into work and it makes me tired and shit. While it's true to a certain degree, it's definitely an excuse. Regardless of how hard I work - I can still do more.</p>
<p>tl;dr - I can do more. I will do more. I won't waste the limited time that I have on this planet</p>
