Oh man. Soo hilarious I'm in tears.

Jason statham. Delivery gold man. Jason Statham actually showing off his acting chops by delivering lines with a straight face. Deng.

This movie was so hilarious. Sometimes I think that the humor is written just for me cause the jokes are like.. so good. But maybe I have mainstream humor afterall... since I feel this was a very mainstream movie.

Highly recommended. You would not expect a Jason Statham / Jude Law to be this hilarious.
