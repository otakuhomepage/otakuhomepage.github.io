<p>So I previously wrote a short python script that prints out the output of the number of days since the new year as well as the percent of the year that has passed.</p>
<p>Here's the output:<br />
[ishida@ishida-fx420 random]$ python days.py<br />
73 days, 23:39:20.857819<br />
20.0</p>
<p>This week was crazy. In so many ways. I guess I'll just write about the highlights. UFC 185. Blew my mind. I can't believe there exists a lightweight that Pettis wouldn't be capable of finishing given his record against the likes of Henderson&#47;Melendez. That's just so shocking. You have a guy that outclassed previous champions... and then this guy comes and manhandles Pettis. That's pretty mindblowing. I guess it just means that you can't take past performance or beliefs as absolute. I mean... I think I'm an excellent Software Engineer... but maybe 2 years from now... I won't be excellent... I'll only be average? O.O. That's kinda of a scary though. Also one that's really hard to believe given how much confidence I have in my abilities and how much I read &#47; work &#47; practice. But I guess anything is possible.</p>
<p>I went to Barry's bootcamp in SF. It was an interesting experience. A bootcamp cost $30 so I don't think I'll be doing it regularly. It was my time bending exercise of the week. The guy to my right was a cardio machine. He was shorter than me... and he did intervals at 11 mph. I maxed out at 10mph. I guess... that kinda really surprised me. That someone shorter than me could easily run 11 mph. Aside from the expensiveness... I don't think I'll do it because I prefer to be able to track my workouts in detail and the whole do as many reps as you can is kinda not my thing.</p>
<p>Shiet, I'm really out of shape. There was a scale at the bootcamp. I'm currently 150 pounds which is the upper limit of my usual body weight. But my strength is at 60% of my upper limit. Which means I got a shit ton fatter since fat weighs less than muscle. That's kinda a depressing thought. I always aspire to be on the up and up and be in the best shape that I'm in. My software skills keep going up and up, and my I want my physical and mental to keep going on the up and up. I've been meditating 3x a week now and I think my mental is definitely in the best shape I am so far. I guess I just need to work on getting back into the best physical shape I've been in. I want to be able to do the muscle up again. And then try out the human flag. The human flag is something that's still on my physical list. Along with a 6 minute mile.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - need to work on my physical side. My tech &#47; mental abilities are at the best it's been thus far. but my physical is slipping so I need to start working out again. nerdy. with science.<&#47;strong></p>
