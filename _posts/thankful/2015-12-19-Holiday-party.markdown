So much to be thankful for this week. I had the so much fun at the holiday party. I got to dress up and shit. I look so goood. Tony always said I was a narcissist. So... now I guess I'm embracing it.

I got myself a fitbit charge hr, sennheiser hd 650 and the fiio e10k. Treat yoself. I'm thankful that I can pretty much buy all the toys and electronics that I want.

I'm thankful for Yakuza 5. It's so good. I'm thankful that someone invented contact lenses. It's so magical. It's like I'm wearing nothing at all (nothing at all). Teehee.

I'm thankful for the Silicon Valley life. Like... it feels like I'm living in the Silicon Valley show. I was smoking weed at the holiday party with my coworkers. It's pretty damn amazing. I didn't bring a lighter as usual and just borrowed someone else's.
