This week... so much to be thankful for. I guess... I'll start with the most recent and go backwards. I'm thankful that... I can buy food and travel. I don't have to worry about travelling because I have lyft. Lyft let's me travel with ease with a friendly driver. I can afford to eat out whenever I want and not have to worry about paying for my food. 

I'm thankful that I got to meeet so many cool people through hip hop. I'm thankful that the people at the hip hop audition was so nice. I had so much fun. It was like a free class. I'm not sure if I made itt.. but I think I'll just operate on the optimistic belief and show up on Monday. And if they say no I'll ask if I can just practice with them in the background or something. Anyways.      I'm thankful thhat I haveeeeee 24h fitness.     Itttttt makes the gym so cheap in the states. And  also because of that I have yoga classsses on Saturday  for free. It's amazing. I'm thankful that I trained myself to have to yoga habit. It was really tough getting out of bed but once I got out the door it was easy to do yoga.

I'm thankful that I work at such a great company in Postmates. I'm thankful that I'm surrounded by warm, and smart people. I'm thankful that we have tea time at postmates. I discovered this new tea place next to Tak Kee Lee. It's pretty coolllllll. I'm thankful for the fact that California has medicinal marjiuana. you know... cause otherwise my health would be bad. i have anxiety, back pain. depression. sleep issues. etc. =|

I'm thankful that I get free food. I'm thankful that my cousins visited me from Toronto. They bought me food... and we shared an amazing experience. We went to a two michelin star restaurant. It was the first time I had caviar. I'm thankful  that I have enough money to afford eating at a       2 michilin star restaurant. The meal cost $650 and uh... I was hungry after. But I'm thankful for the experience, and that I got to share it with my cousins. And that I can afford it without worry. I don't even have to financial plan for something like... ddddespite it's extravagence. I'm thankful that I live a typical... uh minimalistic lifestyle. At least.. relative to  most americans I imagine. That's what allows me to have the random dinners. Even though... I just bought two pairs of wireless bluetooth earphones / speakers and a new microsddd card. A lots of whey.
