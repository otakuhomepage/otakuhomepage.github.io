Hmm. This week was mostly a normal week. I think... time flies by so fast. Let's start with today.

I'm thankful that SF weather is just perfect. Sunny without it being overly hot. I'm thankful that 24h fitness exists and I get to go to yoga class on Saturday. Yoga class cost me $5 if you count my membership monthly divided by the visits of yoga. I'm thankful that I have such a good yoga instructor for such a cheap price. I'm thankful that I can walk to yoga. My walking score in San Francisco is 100. I'm thankful that I live so close to chinatown. I can just wake up and walk to chinatown for delicious food. I'm thankful that I don't have to worry about money. I just went to the bank to withdraw $200.. and I know there are people who need to check their balances before they can withdraw money.. but I just spend without having to worry about money. I don't have to worry about food.

Looking foward: I'm thankful that my cousins will be visiting me. I'm thankful that I have family that I enjoy spending time with. I'm thankful that I have monday off. Even though I'm planning on doing some work on the weekend.

Looking back... this week I'm thankful for all the supportive and amazing coworkers that I have. I'm thankful for the cool opportunity for my career. I do what I enjoy with freedom and flexibility. I interviewed a guy for work today. It was the first technical interview I gave... and I think I might have been more nervous than the interviewee. But... it was a pretty cool experience and I'm thankful for that.

I wrote so much beautiful code. And I learned so much from code reviews. Life is good. I did a badass live deploy while handling race conditions. I feel so badass. 

I'm thankful... that I get to work in my beautifully constructed home. With dual monitors. Standing desk. Sennheiser 598s. And a TV playing my favorite music in the background. Sure... I work long hours... but I enjoy all the time spent working. Like now.... perfect music and coding. Is pretty high on how I enjoy spending my time. It's crazy that my work is so similar to how I would want to spend my time anyways.
