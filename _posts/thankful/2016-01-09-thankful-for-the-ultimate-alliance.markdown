I went out for dinner + dancing with the ultimate alliance group yesterday. It was so much fun. I'm thankful that I get to be a part of a dance group of super cool people.

I think that as I've gotten older I've diversified my friends group...I'm thankful for that. Well... even though I saw that I think all my friends are still college educated and don't believe in creationalism. It's weird that apparently in America half the population don't believe in evolution. But I guess that's a topic for another post.

I'm so thankful for the invention of contact lenses. I think I'm gonna get laser eye surguery at some point in time. It's just so amazing that... I can see clearly without glasses. 

I'm thankful that I live in a city. There's just so much a take for granted. Walking around chinatown/sf/union square. I'm living in the place that people pay to travel to and take pictures of the streets and stuff. I just walk by the buildings and the streets everyday like it's nothing.

I'm thankful that I've met wonderful mentors in my career. It's kinda crazy how good I've become in terms of technical / software competency. I guess that's what happens when I start applying myself and focusing on deliberate practice. At the same time... I guess it's time for me to give back soon. The mentee becomes the mentor huh?
