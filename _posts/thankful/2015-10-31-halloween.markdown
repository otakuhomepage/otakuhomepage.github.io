Hmmm. Recently... it's just been a month of suckiness. So I guess it's really important that I write what I'm thankful for.

I'm thankful that I live in a beautiful home. That I woke up on a Saturday without worry about where my next meal will be or if I can pay next month's rent. I got paged for some site breakage today... I fixed at 3pm and then went out for brunch at 4pm. I'm thankful that I live in beautiful prime location in SF. I walked 10 minutes to this new place I've been wanting to try out in Chinatown.. turns out they close at 4pm and I got there at 4:20. no biggie. There's a new ramen place that just opened 5 minutes away and I went there. Ramen wasn't too good... but I had ramen so can't complain. Then walking back. I take a detour to walk to boba guys. I noticed this newly opened tea place. Called i-tea. I'm so thankful that I live in like... the best part of SF. I'm walking distance from plentea, boba guys, cool tea, destiny's, and now itea. I didn't initially want itea since I wanted boba guys. After walking to boba guys I noticed that the line was LOOOOOOOOONG. So it's time to try out itea. I got the class milk tea and the hokkaido. It was $2 each. OMFGZ. I think it's because it's a grand opening discount. But my mind is blown.

I'm thankful that I have no more real social anxiety. There was a time that leaving the house would be... hard. Now it's like.. nothing. I'm thankful that I get to have delicious boba. I'm thankful that I have a halloween party to go to later. Even though I don't think I'll go. OMFG. The classic milk tea is so good. It has boba and jelly. And it has coffee by default so it's coffee milk tea by default. Damn. So good.

I guess... writing down what I'm thankful for has already made me feel slightly better. I'll write about the horrible news eventually. For now. Peace out. I'm thankful for everyone that reads this.
