I want to write about being thankful for weed. Lol. I guess I am officially part of the Silicon Valley culture. Where all Software Engineers smoke weed and get really high while coding or post working. Anyways... This is the beginning of a new weekly / daily series of being thankful. So. I'm thankful that I live in California where weed is accessible as medicine. I need it for my mental health you know. Because I'm anxious and nervous and stressed and have trouble sleeping. back pain. and neck pain. and depression. i have it all. but i digress. i'm thankful that there are food delivery services in sf. so i can order food and then spend 12+ hours plus at home. Omg. It's happening. My keyboard is curving. Space time is bending. Shit just isn't real. I feel the strain my my in my neck and the misalignment in my posture. and how my shoulders are slightly stiff. I just notice all the small things. And also now the kyeboard is curved. it's like i think of the keyboard and my hands as two halves. i guess one half of the brain control each and so that's why it feels like my brain split in half. i'm notificing so manny things.


anyways. i'm thankful for weed. my friend in college introduced me to it. i think when i first smoked it... i was thinking. holy shit i'm gonna be a druggie. my life is now over. i can't believe i've succumbed to peer pressure. say no to drugs. but at the same time.. hmmm i think i can handle it. let's see what this shit is about. and then. holy shit. i started coughing... i took too big of a puff. but... it was totally worth it. actually... i don't think i coughed that much. i suppressed it. the other guy coughed much more than me. we're just passing it around and smoking. and th en. holy shit. everything is so amazing. dude. let's eat food. let's play video games.

street fighter was so much fun. and then we played castle crashers. and bomberman. video games while high is so amazing. damn. i also think that doing pot is very much a group activity. like that one night pot session bought all of us closer. i felt closer to those that i've smoked pot with once than like people i've known for months. maybe that's why businesses and dates always need alcohol. maybe sharing alcohol has the same effect of group drinking is as communal of an activity as group pot.

anyways. i'm thankful that i was introduced to pot by my friend. fuck proper grammer. this is a blog and semi diary. no need for grammar and capitalization. i ain't no professional writer or editor. i'm a pothead. deal with it. lol. anyways. after that time... i     smoked pot with this friend for quite a few times. it's pretty great.

then. the next time was with an acquiantance from university. he came to visit to smoke. we smoked some by the corner store. all the time... we were super freaked out by possibly cops coming. and this shared fear and excitement. probably bought us much closer than a normal interaction. just being fearful together and excited. and chatting and high. i guess that's why burning man is so popular. group drugs must be a really good bonding experience.

after this i mostly smoked randomly at parties beacuse all my direct link to drugs were gone. but then i moved to california. and then i met someone with a marjiuana license. and then... i ended up getting my own license. but i skip a bit.

i think... hmmm. what was my first edible..... oh. my friend got me this uber loaded brownies. it was kinda fucked up. so... he got the super strong version and uh. it's cordiva i think... and super concentratedd. 2000mg in the brown. for reference... my current load is about 1/2 pf 1/4 of 75mg. Which means... the brownie is crazy. anyways. my friend kenny barfed in a tax after eating it. i felt badass and brave to try it on my own. ate... more than what caused him to puke. since i'm much more badass. oh wait. i skipped some.

i watched the international 4 with uh. my friend. while high. and having lots of costco chocolate chip cookies. hmmm. too many weed stories and i'm getting lazy.

I guess instead of writing about all the little things.. i can just write about oe big thing. and uh. i'm really thankful for weed. amen.
