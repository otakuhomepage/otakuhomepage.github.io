I just made my own sushi sandwich wrap. It was quite tasty. I'm thankful for the ease which I got it. Amazon delivered me the seaweed sheets and chinatown got me the shredded pork fillings.

I'm thankful that I'm healthy now. I was like really borderline sick and I would say that I'm still borderline sick. Might work from home tomorrow to not infect others but... it's good that I'm not deathly sick.

I hang around some really smart people. I'm thankful that I have them in my life. I'm thankful for the great books that I have access to... currently reading hardwiring happiness and wooden on leadership.

SF public transit isn't actually too bad. I'm thankful that I don't need to drive in SF. between public transit / lyft / uber... I'm hella spoiled.

Also I learned how to make essentially pizza hut level garlic bread with cheese at home. Except it's sour dough bread with cheese. I went out to get boba yesterday and it was the chinese new year annual parade. I'm thankful for the #onlyinsf events that I just stumble upon since I live downtown.
