I'm thankful that I was invited to super duper's birthday party. I really thankful that I met such a cool mentor. I met him when I was 23 and first moved to SF and spending time with him is like looking at my life in the future in a lot of ways. I get to learn from other people. I think that at any point in time your opportunities are great but looking back you can only take one path you know - so you want to make sure you're going down the path you want for yourself. And then I see people who have lived the amazing life vs people who just did whatever and ended up where they are.

Super duper was a mentor and a dear friend and I'm really happy for him. He's living the dream. Working 2 days a week and playing starcraft. What a baller. What was I saying..... oh right. Looking back you can only take one path... so you've already neglected and lost time and shit. So you don't want to lose time on the wrong things. At this point it's already impossible for me to do some things. Some of my friends got married at 25 and I know that that's not the path for me I guess.

Anyways... super thankful that I met such a wonderful person and that we've been friends for 4 years. I'm thankful that I live in silicon valley where I can see all the types of people that I could potentially turn into. Do I wanna be a 30 year old engineering director or a 35 year old CTO? Nah. I don't think so. But it's good to know that that's the current path the ship is taking. I gotta steer the motherfucking ship.

Yesterday I went to the birthday party and just played Starcraft 2. It was great. But then... I played on a laptop with shitty gear and posture... and now my back hurts. Blargh. I'm old. I'm thankful for all the great people in my life that I've had the chance of meeting. It's really weird because... everything is like random chance. The interview where they asked you that random question and you just answer with the first thing that pops into your mind. Or whatever. Serendipity in real life.

I went to spin today... was hella sick but I went. I'm thankful that I know that even though I really want to sleep... in the end going to spin is better for me both mentally and physically. Even though it's not what I want to do.... it ends up being the best choice. Which is a lot of things. I don't want to do - ends up being the best choice. That's some gold right there. Alright. I'm thankful. Life is good.
