<p>Sabo is too cool. I think Sabo should be greater than Fujitora power wise but then I think it'll just be a stalemate and then everyone will leave once Luffy beats Don Flamingo.</p>
<p>I am still so excited to see the new power levels of the Straw Hat Crew. It looked like Luffy and Zoro were able to be on par with the admiral. I really want to see Luffy or Zoro lose or struggle so we have a sense what level they're at now. Based on my speculation both of them should be admiral level*ish.</p>
<p>I think that if either of them ran into Akainu they'd be able to last at least for a period of time. Like how Rayleigh could fight on par with the Admirals even though I feel in the long run the Admirals would win.</p>
<p>What I really didn't get was why Ace had to die. Everyone says Ace had to die because Luffy would never be able to become the pirate king living under Ace's shadow... but I feel that Sabo... he's almost in the same situation in a sense that I don't see Luffy surpassing Sabo in terms of power rankings. Damn, I wanna see Marco. Phoenix Marco yo.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - sabo is to cool yo. what a<&#47;strong> badass.</p>
