Get the best pocky [here](http://amzn.to/2162gEu).

Nah. I lied. It's not the best pocky. It's just that... before I ordered it I imagined it would be the tastiest snack in existence. And then when it arrived in two days and I had some... it was only really good. It wasn't as heavenly as I imagined it.

I feel like that's almost a metaphor for life. I always imagine x will be heavenly. And when I get it... it's only good.

Still. This is delicious delicious [pocky](http://amzn.to/2162gEu)
