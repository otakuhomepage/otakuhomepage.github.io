<p>Sigh. I realize that I've become that which I despise. The people who talk about how much junk they eat and how they really want to exercise. The people talking about how fat they are because food is so delicious.</p>
<p>It's really dumb. I think I've somehow fallen into the fat mentality. I haven't been working out and I've just been making bullshit excuses. It's almost like at this point... I identify with being lazy and fat and consuming junk food.</p>
<p>Champions are made through training. By working when other people are asleep. I'm going to go back to my 3 days of working out with 2 of them being night time workouts again. Gym days will be Tuesday night, Thursday night, and Sunday afternoon. I just need to walk to the gym. The weights don't matter. The workouts don't matter. I just need to show up and the rest will take care of itself.</p>
<p>My time bending exercise for this week... hasn't been done yet. But I'm thinking of being like that guy in the ted video and just getting a manicure &#47; pedicure. I haven't ever gotten one.. so I'd think that it would be a time bending experience.</p>
<p>I went to yoga yesterday. The thing is... I was having a lot of trouble just focusing on yoga because my mind was always on work or other things. I think I just need to meditate and exercise more. My lower levels of exercising is messing up with my clear mindedness. Like the&nbsp; mantra of soul eater - a healthy soul resides in a healthy body with a healthy mind or something. Gotta exercise more.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - gym sessions are scheduled in stone. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.<&#47;strong></p>
