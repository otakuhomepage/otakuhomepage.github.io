<p>One piece is the only manga out of the big 3 that I'm currently enjoying. Bleach and Naruto are both sucking right now... I just want Naruto to end... and same thing with Bleach. Honestly, with Bleach and Naruto it feels like the sunk cost fallacy in action for me.</p>
<p>This weeks' one piece was the usual micro serving of amazing stuff. One piece as really slow pacing sometimes, but overall the series is still so good. My favorite character of this arc is probably Sabo. Luffy's big brother #2 and ultimate badass. As the #2 to Revolutionary Dragon he's fighting 1v1 with an admiral like it's nothing. I feel like Sabo should be at least admiral level and probably beyond. So I'm super excited that we're entering the phrase of the manga where pretty much all the characters are approaching admiral level.</p>
<p>Excited to see how the one leg man will fight. It honestly feels like he's operating on pure manliness. No idea how he can even fight properly on one leg.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - Sabo is awesome and one piece is progressing steadily :)<&#47;strong></p>
