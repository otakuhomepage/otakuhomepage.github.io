<p>Went to Blue Ocean and new HK style cafe at Woodbine and Highway 7. The food is so good. Toronto Chinese food is so much better than San Francisco.</p>
<p>I am melting here in Toronto though. I live with no AC and it is 23C+. Gaming wise I'm already on level 17 of DMC. Devil May Cry is such an amazing game thus far, I can't wait to write the full review for it. The only downside is way to much platforming which I am not a fan of.</p>
<p>My sleeping is still messed up though because I've been drinking so much coffee and milk tea. It's currently 3am in Toronto and I'm feeling pretty awake. I don't think I'll be able to sleep for another 30 minutes because I just wrapped up some DMC and it keeps me hyped.</p>
<p>I've recently started watching the Street Fighter shorts on Machinima on youtube. It's pretty damn sweet.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - getting fat and caffeinated from delicious toronto hk style cafes<&#47;strong></p>
