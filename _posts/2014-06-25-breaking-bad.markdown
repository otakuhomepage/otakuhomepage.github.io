<p>Been binge watching breaking bad on netflix. I've just been playing it in the background while I'm coding. I think I've become too critical of shows and real life. It's getting harder for me to suspend belief and immerse myself into a TV show. I mean, the whole premise of the show is retarded.</p>
<p>Some guy gets cancer, and then he wants to start cooking meth in order to support his family. After writing that... I guess it's not that retarded. The retarded part is that people offer to pay for his full medical costs and he's too 'proud' to accept free money. WTF?! So he spends all of his profits thus far to pay for his medical bills. Instead of accepting help and then saving his drug money for his family. Like WTF?! You want money to support your family and you are fucking wasting money paying for healthcare when you could've gotten it for free. WTF is with that logic.</p>
<p>I'm currently on season 2... and he's up $16k after weeks of drug dealing. OMGWTFBBQ. So fail. Then again I don't even have 16k lying around after 1.5 years of working so maybe I should start breaking bad.</p>
<p>tl;dr - walter is retarded</p>
