<p>So after the massive overdose of sugar from yesterday...woke up at 2pm.&nbsp; I went to the gym today. Went to the gym to get my daily dose of exercise but didn't do much else.</p>
<p>Heavenly sword so far is a disappointment. There's no trophy system. The story so far just seems really cliche. The gameplay is a bit straightforward and button mashy. It's nothing like DMC stylish battle combat or god of war where you gotta be alert, block and stuff.</p>
<p>All this time I really wanted to play heavenly sword. and when I got to play it it was a disappointment. I'm not sure if I'll even be finishing it.</p>
<p>tl;dr - finally got to play heavenly sword after the longest time... and it disappoints</p>
