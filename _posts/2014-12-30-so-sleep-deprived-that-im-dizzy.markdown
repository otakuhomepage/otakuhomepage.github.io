<p>So I'm on vacation time now. Which means I've been sleeping&#47;gaming&#47;eating&#47;gymming&#47;binge watching anime&#47;jdramas in no particular order. I'm kind of just free form sleeping and doing stuff without a schedule. Sometimes I'll read an entire book. One day I'll watch 12 episodes of a Jdrama etc.</p>
<p>Pretty sleep deprived for today though. Actually, I wouldn't say that it's sleep deprived. More like my sleep cycle is way off. I slept at 6am when it was bright outside and woke up at 2pm.</p>
<p>I've been listening to the new Jay Chou and JJ Lin albums. JJ Lina and Jason Mraz blows my mind. I still need to work on my writing project which I've been putting off. I've been playing portal 2 and I gotta say the game is pretty damn fun. I'm not sure how many parts there are but I'm on Part 5 of it.</p>
<p>I recently read an article on hacker news about this guy with back pain which was wholly psychological. I'm surprised that the brain can cause back pain to that extent, but I definitely think it's within the realms of reality. Which makes me think that... my bad posture and my recent physical plateau is largely mental.</p>
<p>Growing up I've had bad posture and I think it was made worse by the constant reminders of my parents. You know how when people tell you that you look horribly sick. Even if you feel well, after being repeatedly told that you'll start to feel sick. Maybe by being repeatedly told that I have bad posture it's become a mental block for me.</p>
<p>Similarly, I haven't been working out in a consistent basis in a sense that when I do go work out at the gym I'm usually sleep deprived or in a suboptimal physical&#47;mental state which makes me feel mentally weak. Even 'light' weights feel heavy. I feel that it's largely mental. I'm struggling to run 2 miles in 20 minutes which is surprising. Given that I should be able to run 12 miles over 2 hours without much difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>t;dr - vacation is awesome. i think i need a mental checkup. too bad shrinks are so expensive.<&#47;strong></p>
