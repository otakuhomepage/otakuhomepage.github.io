<p>Sometimes, I just smile and think about my present situation. I mean... thinking back to my childhood dreams - I've always dreamed of living by myself away from my parents and in complete freedom. And, in a way, I've finally achieved it.</p>
<p>It's currently Sunday night and I'm watching Log Horizon on my big screen TV from my bed while eating cheesecake. Life is good. It makes me think... maybe all our dreams do come true. I mean, living by myself.. having cheesecake and watching anime seemed so far away years ago. Maybe 3 years from now... my current dreams will have realized themselves and I'll be watching anime and having cheesecake in an exotic location like France or Japan.</p>
<p>I guess the purpose of this post was to remind myself that I'm living the life that I want for myself and I'm achieving that which I desired for myself. It's good to take a step back and see how far that I've gone and the person that I've become. An otaku software engineer with high level social skills. It's important to be able to talk to people and stuff and life is good.</p>
<p>A quick summary of log horizon so far... everything is amazing. Just like how Sword Art Online started amazing. It makes me miss the days when I would play MMO's. I really enjoyed all the hours and probably years that I've played Ragnarok Online. I really miss the community where there was ~50 people on the server and everyone knew each other. Or... all the high level people knew each other and guild wars were fun. Good times.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - appreciate what you have. chase your dreams. watching anime with cheesecake is awesome<&#47;strong></p>
