<p>It's been less than 24 hours since I arrived in Toronto for vacation. I've just been feeling lethargic. I think it's partially because I've been sleep deprived since E3 and I'm seriously lacking exercise. I haven't exercise since E3 week which is fully one week ago. Me without exercise is not good.</p>
<p>Chris picked me up from the airport and then we went to get food at Congee Queen. My first meal back to Toronto was a big disappointment. I tried something new and it was so bad. During the day I had dim sum with my grandparents and then bobba with my cousin. Then I got home in the afternoon and worked for 5 hours or so. My energy levels just feels zapped.</p>
<p>I kept imagining myself doing crazy cool shit like going through my PS3 backlog. I even bought my PS3 from the US to Canada. You apparently need to take out your PS3 in order to pass through TSA... which is weird.</p>
<p>I forgot to pack my retainers... possibly the most critical thing that I needed to pack and I didn't do it. For shame. blargh. Oh well, nothing I can't handle. I realize now that I own too much stuff. I didn't bring any headphones back, and I was a bit disappointed because I love music on headphones. Then when I got back I realized that I left my Sony XB-300s at home. It's pretty good given it's price, and since I have no alternative... it'll have to do. I definitely miss my Sennheiser 598s.</p>
<p>Well, writing this somewhat recovered my energy levels. I shouldn't just sit here and waste time. So... gonna install my PS3 and get started on Devil May Cry</p>
