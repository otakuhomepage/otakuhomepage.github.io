<p>Didn't go to E3 on day one. We went to Disneyland, and it was a very interesting experience. I think it made me relearn a lesson that I've learned... I'm going to use this blog post as a draft for my post.</p>
<p>I find that a lot of adults really like going to Disneyland. I think that we all want to be the protagonist in the Disney movies and that we want our lives to be like a fairytale. I guess the fantasy is very addicting.</p>
<p>The thing is, at some point in our lives we stop living our dreams and start settling and accepting our situations. I think a lot of the people I know are where they are simply because it became really comfortable to do so. In a way, they gave up the opportunity to live the fairytale life that they wanted and so that's why the really enjoy Disneyland because it gives them a chance to re-experience their dreams and wishes.</p>
<p>For me personally, my life right now is pretty damn comfortable and sweet, it makes me 'postponing' the chasing of my dreams that much easier. Living in San Francisco I get to have groceries delivered to my doorstep (via instacart), I can easily order take out food (via eat24hours) and my lair is complete. I get paid a decent salary and I can afford to buy random shit on amazon. It's kind of hard to give up the guaranteed lifestyle to chase after my dreams when the statistics say that I should keep my job and just work.</p>
<p>The other thing that I wanted to write about is planning and taking action. I think that people who don't plan properly just find themselves older but still with a younger mentality almost. I feel like that's the reason why adults like Disneyland and try to live through their kids. It's because they didn't live the childhood&#47;life that they wanted for themselves. Live the life that you want for yourself... that's the most important thing.</p>
<p>I've realized that I wasted a chunk of my life living it according the way that my parents wanted me to... and now that I've changed that aspect, I'm so much more positive and life is just... good.</p>
<p>I think it's important to always know what it is that you want in life I guess. I still know exactly what it is that I want and I'm continuing to work towards it. Chaos man. Chaos. But the most important thing is sifting through the noise to find the signal.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - don't settle and give up on chasing your dreams. live the life that you want, not the one that others want for you or you'll end up as an old person full of regret.<&#47;strong></p>
