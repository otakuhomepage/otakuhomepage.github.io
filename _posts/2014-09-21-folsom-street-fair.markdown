<p>so I just went to got back from the Folsom Street Fair in SF. It was an interesting experience. I think although I dream of living the otaku life... sometimes I can't resist exploring and going out. But then each time I go out... it's like - damn why'd I go out, I could've been playing video games at home.</p>
<p>The street fair is definitely a very SF event I feel. I saw so many naked people. It seemed to be an event for gay people... &#47;shrug. I didn't really enjoy it, but it's certainly an experience. I'd recommend people who live in SF to&nbsp; go check it out... if only once like me. To learn that you won't like it.</p>
<p>I haven't been journaling or writing in the blog recently. Everything that I can think of is just an excuse. While it's true that I'm working much longer hours at my new job compared to previously, I definitely still have time to do shit and blog. I think I'm just a bit too focused on work recently. In a bit, I'll write about my experiences of job searching and my current job. But for now, let's just say I'm intensely focused on work at the expense of possibly other areas of my life. Since I've started work... I haven't been going to yoga and my workouts have become mere exercise sessions as opposed to training where I aim to keep getting better.</p>
<p>Just looking back at my recent experiences - it reminds me of the book Mastery. I think a lot of the times you don't see your improvement - until you've jumped to the next level. So it's like.. until you jump to the next level, you feel as if you're making no progress. But then at some point - you'll just arrive at the next level. With my software engineering... I've found that whenever I asked people now the answer a lot of the times is 'I don't know' or 'I gotta research'. I no longer run into problem where senior engineers can just give me an answer because if it's a problem that I actually need to ask them for - chances are they don't know it on the top of their head.</p>
<p>I feel like time has been going by really quickly recently. I guess that's the price I pay for going on autopilot for almost 6 months of this year. I recently played Ni No Kuni - and the last time I touched it was December of last year. And right now... it's almost October a year after. Shit... it feels almost like yesterday that I was playing Ni No Kuni. Or, it definitely doesn't feel like 10 months ago.</p>
<p>My life right now is pretty amazing. I'll probably break down a couple pages &#47;. posts to talk about all the amazing services and things that I get. But in San Francisco, with Instacart, Eat24hours, Lyft, Postmates and TaskRabbit. There really isn't much reason to leave the house. I can live the true otaku life in SF.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - saw naked people at folsom. autopilot'd for 6 months. otaku life is good in SF<&#47;strong></p>
