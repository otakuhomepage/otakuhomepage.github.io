<p>I went to the Orthodontist today in order to get my metal retainers removed and having one that I can wear only during night time. That cost me $300. Man, braces is such a scam I feel. So expensive for a piece of metal.</p>
<p>Went to TD bank to deposit a cheque to myself. The exchange rate that TD gave me is a complete ripoff. It's like, you have no choice with banks. No, that's stupid. I paid the lazy tax. I'm sure there is a better exchange rate from a different bank... I always thought TD was a good bank, but I guess this isn't the case.</p>
<p>I finally went to Phoenix. The Hainanese chicken is soooo goood. For work I finally got the action bar working. But then merge conflicts. blargh. Merge conflicts make me sad, because... I expect it to be smart enough. After the merge conflict my R got stuck and weird shit happened which took me way too long to resolve. Basically I spent time fixing stuff that shouldn't need fixing.</p>
<p>I finally got some exercise today. Did jump rope. 200&#47;200&#47;200&#47;20 of regular&#47;single leg&#47;single leg&#47;double loop. Wow, I'm kinda outta shape. The double loop jump seemed so hard. I could only do 3 in a row at a time. My last week at E3 and SF already preemptively fattened me up and made me out of shape. Toronto is probably gonna make it worse. But it's good I got exercise. I also tried to go from crow pose -> head stand in my basement. I flipped over and broke my back. too jokes. Well, I can handle flipping over, and now that it happened, I guess the fear should lessen since I didn't die. It just hurt so much.</p>
<p>Gonna go desserts later tonight, then looking forward to more DMC. I'm trying to get myself to just consistently post on here... then I'll add in the creation of the pages for anime&#47;video games&#47;products.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - tried to do headstand, broke my hip. too jokes.<&#47;strong></p>
