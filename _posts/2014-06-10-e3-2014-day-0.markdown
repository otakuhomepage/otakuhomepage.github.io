<p>Just got to the hotel next to Disneyland in Anaheim. The drive from SF to Anaheim took 7 hours. It's now 4am in the morning and I'm getting ready for bed.</p>
<p>I feel so sleepy, but I feel obligated to write this despite being really tired.&nbsp; I'm really excited for disneyland and E3 with my super cool friends. It's unfortunate that space mountain is out.</p>
<p>I wanted to write something about how the long trip here gave me time to think and ponder on the car, but all my important thoughts seem to have evaporated once we got here and now I just feel like sleep.</p>
<p>tl;dr - super excited for disneyland and e3 2014</p>
