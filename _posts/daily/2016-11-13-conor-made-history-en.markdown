I missed watching Conor McGregor live. I did believe and wanted him to win... and he did. But damn. I messed up my planning big time. Daylight savings time messed up the Japan time to American time. So I was off by one hour. I was suppose to meet a friend at 3. And... I already delayed it to 3:20. It was be an asshole and watch history live... or show up. I didn't really want to be an asshole... and I'm not exactly filled with regret. Just disappointment that I didn't plan it properly. Blargh. Daylight savings time messed me up.

I need to work on my planning. And focus on more of the positives. Today was mostly amazing. But... there was one negative thing which was I missed a language exchange session because there's apparently two St Marc's coffee within the same district and like 10 minutes of each other. Blargh. I thought there was only one. I am an idiot. The thing is... I had a few chances to fix it... but then I was brain dead. Sigh. It's like... I just feel sucky because I know I could've done better. Like... when Edgar got rocked today he recovered to win vs Forrest Griffin mentally breaking against Anderson Silva. Ugh. It's not to say I mentally broke... but I mentally coasted. 

I'm getting close to finishing my first android app. It'll be on the store by the end of this week. Now I'm kinda... feeling ashamed to promote it cause the UX sucks. I know it sucks but I don't really know how to make it better. =_=

Whatever. Some beats none and doing something poorly is better than doing nothing. Damn. That double belt. So much respect.
