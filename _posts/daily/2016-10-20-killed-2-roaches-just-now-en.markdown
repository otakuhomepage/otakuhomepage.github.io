Finished boku dake ga inai no machi and wrote a review. I really liked it. I think it's below steins;gate but above re:zero. 

I watched the documentary on steve aoki. I'll sleep when I'm dead. I didn't know that his dad / family was so badass. The founder of benihana. 

Oh man... I am so weak right now. I need to uh... shuffle my schedule so I get to the gym not starved. Which means waking up earlier and having a decently sized brunch.

Today is my rest day. Gonna explore nearby places for a nice quite coffee shop. Norweigan wood arrived... I could read the first sentence and I feel pretty badass. Lol. I wish katakana didn't exist. I mean... Japanese people would have such better english if they just replaced katakana with english. Also kanji is hard. But that's the way I wish it... not the way that reality is. So I guess I gotta adjust to reality and learn katakana terms for all the english terms.

I spent most of yesterday stuck on running my android tests... sigh. gradle build errors and stuff. When I finally figured out what was wrong (I was using the wrong test runner)... it was close to gym time. I basically spent all day yesterday trying to brute force something with the wrong tool. :(
