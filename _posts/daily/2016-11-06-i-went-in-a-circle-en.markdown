So in my android app... I basically wasted a week. Or rather... from the outside it looks like I wasted a week. Sigh. I tried to be smart and try something new... and in the end I had to go back and use the tried and proven. I guess it's always a trade off of... trying new things versus using knowledge that you already have. Getting more depth of knowledge vs gaining new breadth of knowledge.

There was a time when I wouldn't enjoy the morning. After all... I grew up in the darkness. But now I realize that I'm just like regular people... the sun makes me happy. I think it's in our DNA. Recently the weather in Tokyo has been so nice. And it's so good to be able to wake up at 9am to sunlight.

Two of my friends visited Tokyo already. And I guess things are more fun with friends. In the past I think I would've just preferred to be alone all the time. On the other hand... it's great that I've built up the alone power. Cause... living in Tokyo alone while not speaking the language would be quite tough otherwise.

I started rewatching kekkon dekinai no otoko on netflix with no subtitles. It's great that I already know the story and I'm just using it to learn grammer. I'm still working through Murakami. I'm trying to reach one chapter per week... but it's pretty hard. What's funny is that the chapters in english takes me like 10 minutes to read. 

urgh. I gotta work on language input... typing in pinyin and romanji is... slow. So I guess only english for this entry.
