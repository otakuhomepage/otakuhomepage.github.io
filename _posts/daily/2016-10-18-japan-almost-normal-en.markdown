I think I almost got my daily schedule down so I'm gonna start to add daily writing to it. The daily posts will almost be like the written version of my standups. What I did yesterday, what I'm doing today and things that are on my mind.

Yesterday the main objectives that I set for myself was to visit gold's gym and jexer. Both gyms are 10~15 minutes from my place. The gold's gym looked good except that it was kinda small. There were squat and bench racks and treadmills which was pretty much all that I was looking for. The ceiling was really low though so it'll be hard to do pull ups. Jexer is right by the JR Otsuka station so the location is really good. It looked just cleaner and the lighting was better. Plus it's cheaper and has yoga. So far I'm probably leaning towards Jexer since they have better facilities. I forgot to ask if you can go to another branch. Jexer is closed on thursdays. Open 6 days a week but closed on Thursdays... I wish they closed on Sundays like everyone else. I wanted to make Sunday my rest day. No big deal I guess.

I also finally got my local grocery store's discount card. Everytime I checked out they would ask me if I had a card and I'd be no. It's basically the Japanese equivalent of the safeway card except that every grocery store has their own points card. I kept thinking it would be hard and time consuming since I'm illiterate but it turned out to be easy and straightforward. I finished building my computer the day before yesterday. Yesterday I spent the most of the day setting up my hackintosh. I now have Sierra running on my desktop. There isn't graphics acceleration because the RX-470 is so new... but it looks like Apple and AMD will be adding polaris to OSX and I can't wait for that to officially happen. My desktop OSX has 64GB of ram :D. 

Yesterday night I tried to do some streaming on my Linux machine. Streaming at 720p using the CPU encoder takes my quadcore 3.5ghz (i5-6500) to 85%. That leaves barely 15% for the actual gaming. O.O. Currently there is no GPU based encoding for live streaming on linux for AMD... hoping that'll change so that I can stream without massive lag. If not I'll have to lower quality. But I was surprised by how easy it was to setup. I thought that streaming to youtube from linux would be hard... but it turned out to be quite doable <2 hours.

Yesterday I had one of the moments of intense appreciation and thankfulness for my situation. I'm once again living the dream :D. Just as I finished playing with streaming... I was going to play some Yakuza 0. As I'm setting up the PS4 and walking towards my gaming chair. It's like... wow. I spent my whole day doing desktop linux/osx tech stuff for fun. Was learning how to stream video games and now I get to play Yakuza 0 before bedtime. Life is pretty good. I get to watch anime without subtitles to learn Japanese.

For today - gonna sign up for a gym. Just gonna take a look at anytime fitness before making a decision. Apparently there is an anytime fitness (3rd gym) that's within 10 minutes from my place. Gonna try and get the initial screen up for my android app.
