Yesterday I read Norweigan Wood in a coffee shop. I only read like... 10 pages and it took me forever. But it was a pretty amazing experience.

I also had takoyaki for breakfast. 

I started shigatsu no kimi no uso. I gotta say... I do miss playing the piano from time to time.

Coding for android is hard because the updates and api change so much. When you search for stuff I would say 70% of the shit is outdated and the information is using deprecated APIs. Annoying.
