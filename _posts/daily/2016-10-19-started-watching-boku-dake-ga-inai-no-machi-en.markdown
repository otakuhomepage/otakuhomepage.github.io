Sigh. I just saw a gokuburi behind my fridge and failed to kill it. I had about 2 seconds and I hoped it would move towards a better spray spot but it didn't. And now I know there's at least one roach behind my fridge. Urgh.

Last night I started watching Boku dake ga inai no machi at around 8 or 9pm. I got to episode 10 and managed to stop myself from finish it way past my bedtime. Slept around 12 and woke up around 8:30. Well... I lazied around bed for awhile. So far I gotta say I really like the anime. The opening song is by the great Asian Kungfu Generation that bought the penultimate anime song Rewrite. 

So I discovered that netflix japan has anime from 2016... and that you can watch anime on netflix in Japan with closed captions. Mind. Blown. So basically my learning of Japanese now is like 3 fold. Learn how to read by watching closed captioned anime / video games. I already know hiragana and katakana and then through the voices and speaking I know how everything is read. But I don't quite know the meaning. Well... in anime I can derive the meaning since a lot of the kanji is chinese based. And then watch hollywood / western movies and read the subtitles to see how english roughly translates to chinese. And of course, google translate my writings into Japanese. I think... actually just watching and playing video games and learning how to read speak and inferring the meaning might be the most natural way to learn Japanese. It's how kids learn through immersion. 

I finally finished signing up for my gym. Turns out there was an october special where you get october + november for $10. Yesterday I did my first deadlift in Tokyo. Life is good. I also figured out how to stream from the PS4. It's surprisingly easy. I think I'll start streaming Persona 5 once I'm done Yakuza 0. I feel that my Japanese is actually good enough to understand most of it. Probably.

Today is just code for 6 hours. Which is the usual. I think I'm just solidifying my daily Japan life at this point.
