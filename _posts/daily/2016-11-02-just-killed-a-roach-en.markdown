Just killed a roach. It was probably my previous definition of a mega roach. But now it does freak me out as much. It's like. Came out of the bathroom -> saw the roach on my wall. Fuck. A roach. Urgh. Go grab the spray. Spray it to death. Watch it struggle as it died. Then... I thought about wearing my dishwashing gloves plus toilet paper to grab the roach. But then I figured... growth mindset and whatnot. Or... exposure therapy for fear. I just used a tissue without gloves and picked up it's corpse and flushed it down. I think having the spray makes a pretty big difference. You don't gotta worry about making a splat on the wall.

I'm working through Your Lie in April. I'm really enjoying it since the music and OST is just beautiful. The story is good so far... but honestly it's the music that brings it to life. I guess in that way anime is superior to manga. I wonder who did the composing for the anime... cause that is so mad skills. Someday when I don't have to work I want to just live in my place and practice piano and learn the violin. Someday.

I'm starting to be able to read the subtitles on the anime really well now. It's an... undescribable feeling. I think I'm probably learning just by audio/visual feedback. I can even read kanji with like 50% accuracy when it comes to anime. It's like... I don't know how I can read it. But I can. hehehehe. The other day I met this girl from HK whose fluent in Japanese. She learned via textbooks and my mind was blown. You attained fluency via textbooks?! NANYATE!? But I guess that's how a lot of people learn... through textbooks. Just that studying is really boring for me kinda goes back to always doing things according to your style. It's like the multiple solutions to a problem... there's no real ideal solution. Or rather, the ideal solution is unique to the individual.

I'm going to go back to writing short dailys. Because I'm only going to be in Japan for 365 days. Probably only another 300 days at this point. I gotta take advantage and appreciate each day. Because each day is a present :)
