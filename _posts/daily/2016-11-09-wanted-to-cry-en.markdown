I wanted to cry earlier today... it was stupid. What happened was... I've been trying to spend the last... 2 days getting my hackintosh set up with every thing working. I bricked my machine thrice and I had to do a full install each time it got bricked. The gpu acceleration would never work or the sound would never work. There were ugly ass graphical glitches. I was really frustrated since I expected it to take less than a day. I guess that's just my estimation skills being off. Anyways... earlier today at 1pm I already spent 1.5 whole days working only on getting OSX working. I guess that made me really annoyed. I just dropped everything and went to the gym. Even though I was feeling exhausted.

I went to the gym and it was the usual stuff. I tried to do deadlifts... and I was just feeling really weak. But instead of doing nothing... I dropped the weight by ~20% and still did some reps. Some beats none. I then I told myself I'd just get on the treadmill... I could just run 10 minutes... and I ended up running the longest highest pace distance run that I've done this week. So I'm feeling pretty badass.

I got home and told myself that I'd figure it out. And I did. My hackintosh is officialy working with 64gb of ram and intel HD 530 gpu acceleration. Unfortunately no RX470... but hopefully soon if apple gets their shit together. I decided on adding another rest day since I think I should enjoy my time in Tokyo more. So Thursday/Sundays will be free days. Days where I just drink coffee and read Murakami. Hehehe. :)
