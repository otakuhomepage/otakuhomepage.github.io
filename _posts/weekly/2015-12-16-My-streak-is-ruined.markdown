My github streak got ruined. Boo. Well... I let it happen. In a way I guess. Yesterday, I stayed late at work. Got dinner with the team and then headed back to the office and was there until 12:30am. We did a lot of design / planning. It was actually quite fun. Because... it's interesting to see all the different viable ways of solving the problem and how everyone kind of has a preference towards certain technologies and unique risk tolerance.

I went to spin today. I missed my workout yesterday, but post spin today I snuck in the shoulder workout so I'm gonna mark that down as my 5x5 workout. I'll probably do a workout this Friday night in order to balance out my Tues/Thursday with Wed/Fri.

The company holiday party is tomorrow. I'm looking forward to just celebrating and kicking back with people. And getting to know people better. And taking lots of pictures since I'll be dressing up. It's like one week from Christmas... and I haven't gotten myself a present yet. I'm eyeing the Sennheiser HD 650. I'm thinking either the Sennheiser HD 600 or Sennheiser HD 650. I'm like 70% leaning towards the HD 650... because treat yoself.

I've been playing Yakuza 5 some more. It's definitely the game of the year for me. It's so good. The only thing bad about it... is sometimes the mini games feel too forced. And also... the messed up the order of the chapters. Chapter 2 is soooo boring compared to Chapter 1. I wish they swapped it. So I'd be bored and then excited rather than super excited then disappointed. But oh well.

I haven't had much time to read... I'm still working through the CBT book and of course my backlog of books is like 10ish books still. =/
