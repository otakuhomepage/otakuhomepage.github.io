Coders at work is blowing my mind. Damn. Shit. It's so relevant. And it's like.... what's relevant in the 80s is still relevant now. Computer Science is less than 100 years old... and most of the pioneers and greats today are still alive. It's like... living in the same generation as da vinci or something. Or newton. Shiet.

Only one chapter in so far. I have three drafts.. and I think that by not writing and publishing my writing habit regressed. So just gonna publish this in order to start day 1.
