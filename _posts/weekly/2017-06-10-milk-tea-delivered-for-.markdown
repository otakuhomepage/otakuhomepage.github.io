Wow. I got Milk Tea delievered for $6. It's been awhile since I had boba delivered. I guess... the Postmates business model wouldn't work in the Phillipines. Or maybe... it'll work super well because... I dunno. But delivery is so cheap. Everything is so cheap. Apparently minimum wage in Phillippines is... 400 per day which is like. $10 usd. So the average person makes $400 usd in a month. Wow. Mind. Blown.

It's my last day in the Phillippines. Just chilling in the hotel room and uh waiting to watch the SSL. Solar vs Innovation. I got Innovation winning by overwhelming force. Since my friends left I've been having the chillest vacation. I got a massage today. For $30 you get a 2 hour massage. I can't believe I spent like $200 for a massage in 'murica. 

I was suppose to do some ios programming in the Phillippines... but in the end it didn't happen. Because... maybe it's the environment. Afterall, I'm on vacation. But I did pack 5 volumes of YuYu Hakusho and I managed to read 5 volumes in the 10 days that I've been here.

The morning coffee + sandwich is the best. I go to this place that is like 10 minutes from the hotel. I'm the only person in the store so it feels very chill and super exclusive. For $6 I get breakfast and delicious delicious coffee. The matcha latte and chai latte are both really good. I'm impressed by the quality of the coffee. The food is meh. But for $6, the food plus environment is the shit. Man. I'm so spoiled. 

I definitely got super fat though. I've been eating pork belly almost every meal. No exercise. But right before I think I hit 35 minutes at 15.1 so this 10 days was a decent recovery. I'm looking forward to resuming my usual cycle and going all out at the gym. With my almost daily massages as recovery. I think I'm all set to push myself.

I've also been watching alot of Dragon Ball Super. I went from episode 1 ~ 75 during my time in the Phillippines. I feel like... there's too much filler / junk. A lot of the power levels don't make sense. How can Android 17 face Super Saiyan God Goku. Like. WTF. Sigh. That said. I'm actally enjoying it quite much. It's like. Nostalgia plus... everyone likes a tournament arc. Especially the battle tournament.

YuYu Hakusho is so good. It's... pretty much masterclass shounen. Togashi sensei is indeed a god. I'm not religious so... god is just sublime skill in this case. I wish Hunter x Hunter would resume. Hunter X Hunter is like... the successor and better version to a masterpiece. It's sad but I'm already on volume 17 of Yu Yu Hakusho which means only 2 volumes before it ends. On the plus side... once I finish... I'll have completed one of my goals which is to read an entirely new manga series in Japanese. I feel pretty badass.

I mean. When I first wrote out my Japanese learning goals. Being able to karaoke in Japanese, reading an entire manga series, playing a Japanese video game and understanding everything. It felt... really far. But then I played Persona 5 and got half of it in my first try. I beat the game understanding only half of it. Well. Probably more. But I missed a lot of the finer details. And then three playthroughs later... I'm understanding pretty much all of Persona 5. It's just... I made the jump.

With Haskell. I'm currently reading a book. This book should hopefully get me over the hump of haskell. I feel like... I'm so close. With Haskell... I can feel my powers growing. Like. I'm one or two a-ha moments away from being mind blown and in love with Haskell. I mean. I already appreciate it to a great extend. Just writing haskell and seeing my work... it brings a smile to my face. That I can *almost* appreciate other people's Haskell code. I'm waku waku.

It's already mid June. Kinda scary. I only have 2.5 months left of Tokyo. DAMN. DAMN. When I first moved here it was like... I have an entire year. So much time to kill. Now it's like.... only 2.5 months. Shiet son. Shiet.

One other thing I want to quickly write about is. Shit. I'm kinda worried that people will think I'm crazy. But whatever. I read somewhere that once people think you're crazy or once your diagnosed as crazy you can't prove your sanity. So whatever. Fuck it. I'm crazy. I walked about 2 km from the hotel to the mall. And the roads here... it's like really narrow. So the sidewalk and the road is almost touching. The cars drive by probably less than 10 cm from you.

So during the entire walk from the hotel to the mall. My brain kept telling me I was gonna die. It was like. Every second I was super nervous and anxious. Like. Fuck. You gonna die. You gonna die. Which is.. stupid because I did the walk 3 times and I never died. Yet, my brain kept telling me I was gonna die. Sigh. Why brain why. Why you no be helpful. It's like... the signals I'm getting is totally useless to what I want to do. In fact, it's worse than useless, it's a net negative cause I gotta tell myself I'm gonna live while doing the walk. So I'm walking with less available attention. I lived. So I guess that's good.

That's it for now. Gonna go watch Innovation crush Solar followed by hopefully the uh... big tournament in Dragon Ball Super. Oh yeah. I just wanted to write that it was great that Future Trunks didn't turn out to be a weakling and that he beat Dabura. Cause... in my mind. Kid Gohan > Cell > Dabura. And Future Trunks SSJ2 > Kid Gohan > Dabura which is good. 

It's good when my crazy theories gets validated. Yep. I'm crazy. Deal with it.
