I went to the gym and it was great that I went. Had delicious lunch today eating noodles, dumplings and uh... fried pancakes. Ooo. I went to house of pancakes.

Got mauled in magic the gathering. Blargh. Tomorrow is the first saturday of OT. Man. I'll have 2 saturdays of overtime followed by a weekend of on-call. That means I've been working 5/6 weekends. Sigh. I work way too much.
