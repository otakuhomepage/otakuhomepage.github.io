Wow. Today is actually going to be my last day of work. I already commited my last code. It's... 1:50am. And work is in 7 hours. But tomorrow is gonna be mostly chill and writing docs and stuff. It's crazy. I won't have to wake up for work... for like the 1.5 years. Wow. I get a 1.5 year vacation. I gotta say I'm prety stoked.

It's something that I've been dreaming about... and now that it's almost reality... I don't know how I feel. I had chicken dinner with my coworkers today. It just randomly happened since we were playing video games and then I just tagged along. It was pretty fun.

So one of my coworkers told me that he took a house dance class. And it's super cool that I know all these house dance moves. Thanks Buster. The Jack :D Actually I think my favorite move is the reverse jack. Hue. Hue.

I haven't been writing... or doing my 3 thankful things. I'm thankful that I got catered lunch. I'm thankful that I got such wonderful training in silicon valley (I did my last interview today). I'm thankful that I have access to amazing american credit cards. I just got the united 50k credit card promo. I got 200k miles in the past year... since I reached the pinnacle of american credit worthiness in 3 years.

Tomorrow will be lots video games, magic and celebrations. Life is good.
