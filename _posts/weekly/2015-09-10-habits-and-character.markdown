Hmmmm. It's now 2am and I was passed out on my bed from 10pm ~ 1am. I just wanted to write that I was really sleepy today. Like. When I got home. I was basically asleep on my bed at 6:50. Yet. I managed to get myself to spin class. I feel like such a badass.

Although I was suppose to do laundry today... I kinda ran outta steam after spin. I spent labour day weekend with an old friend playing starcraft. It was a pretty interesting experience.

I think I give myself a lot of pressure to deliver at  work. THe pressure I put on myself is probably higher than the expectations of my peers. And I don't think it's that healthy. I wanted and planned on doing some work over the weekend... but then ended up not doing it because I was just really spent. I had my laptop open and the code open.. but my brain just wasn't working. I tried to work for about 2 hours and then just gave up. I told myself that I'd be able to crush it on Tuesday. And. I did. The actual work took me less than 2 hours... so I guess in a way I wasted 2 hours of my life worrying and trying to work. Even when there was no expectation of me working.

I think it's important to just recognize when you aren't productive or whatever. Okay. At this point my brain isn't working so that'll be the end of the weekly. But holy crap... it's already 70% of 2015. Whoa. Kinda crazy.
