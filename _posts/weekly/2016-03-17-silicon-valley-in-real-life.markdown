I think we should hire her because new grad and diversity. I actually said that today. Ummm. I'm officially living in Silicon Valley.

New grads are choosing us over google. That's... kinda crazy. Well... I guess I'd choose us over google too. But still.

I had coffee with our VP of product. Apparently he doesn't read any product books and he was trained by Jack Dorsey and Gokul Rajaram. Moral of the story? To become great just find outstanding mentors. Hmmm. Hmmmm.

Holy shit. It's already mid march. In 2 weeks I'l have a performance. And 3 weeks I'll be in dominican republic. Mind blown.
