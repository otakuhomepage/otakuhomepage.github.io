Went to spin today despite feeling sick. I think spin actually made me feel healthier after sweating it out.

Off to anime night with friends. We're watching mirai nikki. Even though I've already seen it... it's more about just chilling with friends I guess. 

Edit: Just got back from shuffle. So much fun. But uh... frigggg. I feel old. Lol. I think I pulled a back muscle cause I went too intense without warming up. Damn. Warmups are so important now that I'm old. BooHoo.

I've been HEALing myself. I'll write about the book at some point later.
