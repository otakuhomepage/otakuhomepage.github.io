Whoa shit. Almost forgot about my weekly. Damn. too scary. My streak. 

My sleep... is all messed up. I think that sleep deprivation causes me to uh.. be dizzy and off balance. It literally throws off my orientation when I'm sleep deprived. And I've been hella sleep deprived. And I gotta work this saturday.

On the other hand... I guess I'm better than the people that have to work multiple jobs in order to put food on the table. I guess. First world problems.
