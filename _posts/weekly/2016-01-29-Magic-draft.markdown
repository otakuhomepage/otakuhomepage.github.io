I just got back from gamescape in SF. I went drafting with a coworker... it was a very interesting experience.

First of all... I guess it's cool to try out new things. Uhh. It was quite fun. I just wanted to write about how... in the past I would have social anxiety or like... feel kinda nervous when trying out new things. But today I didn't feel nervous at all. Nothing at all. Nothing at all (stupid sexy flanders). Lol.

I haven't played magic in awhile. They introduced a new colorless color which is essentially a new color so I don't get why they didn't just introduce a new color but whatever. I lost 2/0 twice. And both times I could've extended the game / made it much closer instead I was being retarded. I feel kinda salty. And also dumb. Mostly dumb but whatever. I had fun. That's all that matters.

Honestly... I think I just played really dumb. Sigh. I made so many mistakes. It's like... I played when I shouldn't played. I attacked when I knew that they would have instants/counters. And I didn't play my spells because I was newb. Sigh. I guess I am salty. I gotta just let it go.

I've been cutting laundry really freaking close. I'm down to my last pair of clean underwear. So tomorrow after yoga and shower... I'l be wearing my last pair of clean underwear. Guess I 100% must do laundry tomorrow.

I got splashed by a car today. It was raining and a car drove into a puddle on the side of the road. It was sad because uh... I visually saw the water coming. And time slowed down. But my body didn't move. Or rather... I didn't move my body. I just saw the water moving slowly towards my legs and then time resumed when I got wet.

I guess... I play too much video games so I have the eye reaction but not the body reaction. O.O. It's time to learn karate and judo so I can ninja dodge water when I see it come at me in slow mo in the future. Alright. I was worried that I would lose my streak but I got back home at 11:15. And I wrote this. My streak of writing daily posts goes on. Life is good. 45 day streak yo!
