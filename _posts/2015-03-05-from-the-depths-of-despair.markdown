<p>Man. I was deathly sick these past few days. It started Saturday Night... and then it went from Sunday til Wednesday. I was feeling like complete and utter death. The sickness just saps your willpower. I always thought that I'd be able to resist torture and stuff.. but when you're sick your brain just fails you.</p>
<p>I couldn't focus because of the headaches and body aches and stuff. Everything just felt like death. Then all of a sudden I'm feeling great now. It's the sign that I'm on the recovery. My energy just spiked up.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to go crazy now that I'm feeling slightly better. But I'm gonna take it easy still. The fear of relapsing into the death sickness is... to close. What I wanted to write about is that there's always a light at the end of the tunnel. When I was sick... all I could think about was death and how life sucks. But now that I'm slightly recovered... I can see all the positive aspects of life.</p>
<p>Just because life sucks right now doesn't mean it won't get better. If your life sucks and you're at rock bottom. It means you can only go up and up. ;)</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - was deathly sick for 4 days... now I'm feeling hope again<&#47;strong></p>
