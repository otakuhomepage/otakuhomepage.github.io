<p>shiet. it's 2015. shit. i think it was weird for me writing 2014 in my dates form. and now it's 2015. that's crazy. i think it feels like 2012 to me still. 2012 is the year that i'm used to writing. O.O</p>
<p>first workout of 2015. went to spin class. it was normal but it just felt out of shape since i didn't exercise for 2 weeks and was eating pizza 5 days a week for the past week.</p>
<p>my feet still feels icky, but it doesn't hurt or itch as much now. no idea what happened but i'm on the recovery. vacation for only 2 more days now. then it's back to work. it's kinda weird in a sense that i kinda miss work when i'm on vacation. that said... i definitely prefer vacation over work. or do i?</p>
<p>my sleeping is getting slightly better. i think i slept at 5am this morning and woke up at 12pm. so slept for 7 hours. the only thing that sucks is that i can't sleep. i tried to sleep at 3am yesterday &#47; this morning and i couldn't fall asleep. my mind just kept going.</p>
<p>i've been playing deus ex human revolution at last... and i gotta say it's pretty damn good. the only thing sucky is the amount of walking you have to do on the map and the fact that there is no indicator to tell you how to get to your destination. the world is 3d but the map is 2d so you could be at your destination but then it's like inside the building on the last floor or something.</p>
<p>tomorrow i'll be visiting UC berkeley with Kumar so I'm looking forward to that. I'm planning on waking up at 10am and then having coffee and egg tarts before meeting him at 11am. Hopefully that'll start to put me back on my 9am wake up time for work.</p>
<p>I still have 6 hours today so I can probably put a good solid 4 hours into playing deus ex human revolution</p>
