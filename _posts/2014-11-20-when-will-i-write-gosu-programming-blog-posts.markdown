<p>So I just read this article: http:&#47;&#47;blog.memsql.com&#47;cache-is-the-new-ram&#47;</p>
<p>It was a super interesting read. With diagrams and shit. It's really funny because I feel like I'm out dated. Memcached is so 2004?! Damn, I'm still struggling to use Memcached.</p>
<p>noSQL is 2008?! I feel robbed. I learned nothing about NoSQL in University. Well... I did get to learn Map&#47;Reduce so maybe my University wasn't totally outdated.</p>
<p>I think I need to work on my Software Engineering communications. The RFCs that I write at work are so bare bones and simple. Other people write such eloquent and understandable RFC's. It's like reading poetry. I can't wait till I become an artist level Software Engineer. It's good that I still have room to grow I guess.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - hackernews is a good source of programming reads<&#47;strong></p>
