Check it out [here](http://www.maxims.us/never-ever-quit/)

My own personal thoughts on quitting... I think it's important to quit for the right reason. There's no point in rejecting reality. If you try to build a product and then there's no users... maybe there is no market for your product. On the other hand... maybe you shouldn't give up too soon. One on hand I believe that you can through sheer force of will make shit happen.

On the other hand... you need to think about whether the path you're taking is optimal or not. I quit things all the time because I use the time for something else that I think is more important. But I don't ever quit going for something that I want. Because there's always a way and you never give up.

Like the original. You need to realize when you're digging a hole and going down the wrong path. And you gotta stop. So don't brute force the wrong path... but don't be afraid to brute force a shitty detour.
