I already knew about this but I think I'll write about this since a recent event reminded me about it.

Everyone values different things. And what could be worthless / equivalent to someone could mean the difference between heaven and earth to another. That's some crazy ass shit. What happened was that I was taking my dad to the cheesecake factory in SF. It's located on the highest level of a retail building and since it's the only cheesecake factory and always busy - they don't take reservations. You sit whenever and wherever a table frees up.

As we were getting seated... this group of four europeans were argueing with the waiters saying that they wanted to sit by the window. Because the window seat has such an amazing view and is the shit. They were annoyed that they couldn't sit there because that's not how the system works. And then the waiters were like... if you ask these guys (me) and they are okay with the swap then you can sit there. So they're like yo - can we sit by the window? And I'm like sure go ahead. I just wanna eat food. In my mind... the window seat and the middle seat has no difference. If anything... since I have a slight fear of heights... the window seat might made me slightly nervous. But anyways... I gave them the window seat and they were like so happy. Omg that guy is so nice. And I'm thinking - nah I'm a selfish asshole. It's just that the window seat means nothing to me.

And then the guy was like. Sir, can I buy you a drink? And then it's like... uh thanks. But I don't drink. And then I asked my dad if he wanted a free drink. And then he refused too. I guess offering to buy someone a drink is just a gesture of goodwill. But it's like... buying me a drink or offering to buy me a drink to me is like... the equivalent of yo guy, do you want me to infect you with hives and rashes? Oh... I made the huge mistake of drinking gourmet whisky and then went into shock once. I blame $200 whisky but that's for another story I guess.

***tl;dr - everyone has different value systems. you see the world through your own values... but other people generally have different values than you***
