I got my resident card updated to my new address today. I had to walk 30 minutes in the pouring rain each way... but it was a good time bend. I think walking in the rain is always a time bend because it's kinda hard to fast forward the bad times. Kinda like how yoga is always a time bend.

My PS4 arrived along with persona 5 and yakuza 0. I started playing yakuza zero and I'm progressing at a snail pace because I'm forcing myself to read every single katakana and hirigana that exists in the text. The katakana totally threw me off... now I know why all Japanese have such bad english. They learn english not natively... but via katakana. I kept struggling with words like fighting which is faitingu and training which is terainigu. I actually struggled with watashi. Because a foreigning speaks watashi in katakana apparently. =_=

So Yakuza 0 has a stream blocking feature... and I'm too lazy to circumvent it. So I'm just gonna not stream it for now. I'll look into streaming Star Ocean 5 and Persona 5.

It's predicted to rain every day for the next week. I miss the greatness of California.... and specifically SF. Even though SF is typically rainy... it was drought year for the years that I was there. I started meditating 3 days in a row... it's nice. I also managed to fix my sleeping. Before I couldn't wake up before 9. Now I'm waking up around 8 and it's nice to have the time to just meditate... and then do some work and reading in the morning.

I also discovered the eat24 for japan. And I already ordered food two nights in a row. It's called Maishoku... and their site is even in english and they accept credit card payments. Time to live the shut in life. Hue. Hue.

I also watched the first episode of Re-Zero on amazon prime video jp. Amazon prime in japan is $30 a year. Even without the 2 day shipping... the prime video alone is worth $30 a year. Mind blown. I struggled to find the app but it was region restricted. Now I have 3 PSN accounts. 1 Canada, 1 US and 1 JP. I accidently used prime video on the US account and bought prime. It literally was one click and I got charged $100. But then I cancelled it and got a full refund right away. So I guess amazon is good in that regard. 

Amazon.jp is pretty amazing... it's just as good as amazon.com. It's more expensive and less choice but the delivery is so fast. I'm spoiled. Life is good. I just gotta deal with a stinky spare bedroom and once that's fixed... my place in Japan will be a pretty amazing home. I set up the PS4 and the TV so it's already feeling much better.

It's funny that I went to the government office to get my resident card updated and was so illiterate that I couldn't write my own name in katakana without referring to my phone. Sad... but jokes. It's funny that the whole process only took 3 hours though. It's like... I guess that's how illiterate people make it through life. It's an eye opening experience. I was kinda sad but now I'm more amused. Well. Gonna sleep soon. Got an amazon package for tomorrow... and then dinner with a friend of a friend.
