Yesterday I broke my plateau. It was... the greatest and stupidest shit ever.

So I've been following the 5x5 workout for probably about 1.5 years now. There's been time when I just stop going to the gym and get weaker and stuff. But what would happen is that I would *always* struggle to do the last 5 reps of the 5x5. So I wouldn't really add the weight. Yesterday I just added more weight than usual. I told myself that I was strong and that I could do it. It was a lot easier than expected. 3x rep at a higher weight was about the difficulty of 5x at the lower weight. Which... blows my mind. Maybe... it was just mental. It was a mental block and that once I told myself I could lift it I could lift it. =|

It's hard to tell the mental from the physical though... so probably not a good idea to just believe when you have no workout experience. Still... it blows my mind. All I had to do was... add more weight. And believe.

I think that's the case for pretty much all things. If you think you're lazy and weak... you'll probably just act lazy and weak and it'll prepetuate. But then how do we get rid of bad thoughts and get good ones? I've been skeptical of autosuggestion from think and grow rich... but maybe I'll give it a shot. I mean... it's probably better than praying to god. -_-

I went to Shibuya for Halloween yesterday. Shit. I think I am BJ Penning. Sigh. I think I just... learned some bad habits and thought patterns. Now I gotta unlearn shit and unlearning is probably harder than learning. Well. Whatever. Boku nara dekiru.
