I'm convinced that at a certain size... corporations just become evil and retarded. I just tried adding someone on linkedin for the first time. He's one of my coworkers who is leaving the company. Anyways... we both have the same fucking company in our current resume. LinkedIn even *knows* we're linked by current company. When I click add -> It asks me for our type of relationship. W.T.F. Then.. in the dropdown for work.. you have to select the company that you worked together in. Every single company was on the dropdown... except for my current company. Sigh. That's some fucked up UI. I got really pissed off by this retardedness. Man. LinkedIn. That's... sigh. I guess they have the monopoly so they can just fuck you over. Like Peter Thiel said... it's all about that monopoly. Anyways. I'm never ever adding another person on linkedin ever again.

The other thing is airbnb. I was planning out my trips/vacations for the year. They demand your ssn / passport and access to other accounts in order to book. A credit card and wads of money isn't enough to let you book on their website. Sigh. That's fucked up. I spend thousands of dollars on amazon and they don't have my ssn. I sure as hell ain't giving it over to airbnb. It's disappointing... but whatever. I ended up using flipkey. Whoever was the retard at airbnb that decided on mandatory id for customers is just retarded. Well. I think it's fucked up. I'm curious to know the logic behind the PM/person's decision. Well. Other places did the job so I won't be using airbnb again.

***tl;dr - both linkedin and airbnb have fucked up ui and product decisions. it's such a disappointment that they're valued billions of dollars but suck monkey balls***
