I started reading [maxims](http://www.maxims.us/be-not-afraid-of-conflict/) and it's pretty cool.

I use to think that conflict was bad but now I see that sometimes it's essential. Conflict leads to progress and sometimes it's necessary. I really want to write about the there are no rules part.

I think the important thing is to not avoid or fear conflict. I think it's like the full circle. Before I would be afraid of conflict. But now that I have no fear of conflict... I generally avoid conflict for reasons other than fear. The important thing overcoming that fear. It's think as long as your reason is sound and you have no fear then everything is good.

I think it's more important to have no fear but that's probably a different thought.
