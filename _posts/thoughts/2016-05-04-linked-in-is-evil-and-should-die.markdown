I just tried adding my coworker / manager. 

How do you know Andrew? Bullet points. Blargh. So much work to add a connection which makes linkedin a better network.

Select colleague. Dropdown pops up. Ffs. Fuck. What the fuck. 

Okay. Other. Enter his email..?! DAFAQ.

Fuck that shit. Friend.

Ok. I can add him now.

Dear linkedin. Your UI sucks. Your email spam for find your network sucks. I hate your anti patterns. I think I should stop using linkedin.
