I wanted to write about not rushing and being patient. Whenever you rush you make mistakes and rushing tends to cause tunnel vision and stuff... but then I was watching Parasyte and then there's a even bigger mistake than rushing which is denying reality.

Reality is what's in front of you. There's no point in denying reality. Those that deny reality are crazy... and yet so many people choose to not accept reality as it is. In the show... when an evil person appears... the guy doesn't believe that evil person exists and subsequently gets stabbed in the gut. He totally deserved it for being retarded. And yet... so many people don't accept reality.

On the other hand... I'm a big believer in the interpretation of reality. Which means that you can look at the same reality (event) from different angles in order to make your life better. The other thing is... I think that to become great - like top 10 in the world great... you need some type of crazy belief system. Like how McGregor believes that he's unbeatable even though he was beaten previously.

***tl;dr - don't deny reality but interpret reality in a way that benefits you***
