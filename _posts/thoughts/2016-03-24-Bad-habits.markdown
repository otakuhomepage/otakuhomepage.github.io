Everyday I'm shuffling. So I just got back from a shuffle session and the slow room was unavailable so we only had the one mega fast room. I can't shuffle at full speed in the fast room. Well... I can but only for about 4 beats. Anyways. I skip the middle step when I try to make the beat because it's too fast for me. In a sense... I practiced bad habits today. And practicing bad habits are the worse. It's why change is so hard.

Let's say you want to change something. If you've been say. Smoking for 10 years. You have 10 years of bad habits learned and then unlearning it is really hard. Just like how... today I think it'll take me more work to unlearn some of the bad practice I had. I was really conscious of it so I would stop once I caught myself. But I still ended up practicing a few bad habits.

I guess. As soon as you decide on a change. Your old behaviour has had probably years of experience. You know. Years of the bad habit... and each time you do a bad habit it's like -10. Vs the good habit which is +1. So one bad action sets you back 10 good actions. It's like going on a healthy diet. If you have the chocolate cake... that'll set you back the equivalent of 10 healthy meals. Or something like that. The ratio isn't exact. But it's at least 2:1. Basically. Don't practice bad habits. Step one is to recognize. And step to is to do stop the bad habit. Just by stopping the bad habit... it's good enough I'd say. It prevents you from going into the negative. Of course... practicing the good habit is ideal.

***tl;dr - bad practice and bad habits compound. don't do it. It's like -10 vs +1 for a good action. Each misstep cost much more than a positive action***
