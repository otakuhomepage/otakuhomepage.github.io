For some reason whenever I have to do things... I always have this intense struggle and deliberation of wasting time. Like today when I had to send the email out to my coworkers that I would be out in the morning tomorrow. I knew that I needed to send the email regardless... and that the behaviour was totally accepted. But like... I just feel like delaying and not doing it.

I dunno why. Something that I want to work on is just doing what it is that you're suppose to be doing. I think... it's like a remnant of self sabotage... fear of success maybe? Like... I'm just a horrible person to myself sometimes.

Just now... writing this post should been like 10 sentences. And yet it took me probably 30 minutes. The big idea is do what you gotta do without hesitation and yet all I could think about was hesitating and delaying even though I need to post something to maintain my streak.

I think the longer you delay the harder it gets so you might as well try and get shit done asap. More delay == harder. Just. Do. It. Shia Labeouf.
