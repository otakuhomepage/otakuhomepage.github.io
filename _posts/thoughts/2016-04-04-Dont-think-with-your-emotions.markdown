Don't think with your [emotions](http://www.maxims.us/dont-think-with-your-emotions/).

```
Emotions are the enemy of logical thought: loneliness, perfectionism, fear, elation, guilt, pride, stress, vengefulness, boredom, humiliation, insecurity, regret, and despair cloud your ability to make good choices.

If you want to make a smart decision, you have to leave your emotions out of it. This is why the best decisions are made on paper: by writing everything down, and basing your decision on whatâ€™s been written down, you become aware of any emotions impacting your judgement.

I just meditated for 15 minutes for the first time in a week. I didn't think that I needed to meditate... but it turns out that I totally did. I think that when I don't meditate... sometimes my emotions just spike for no reason. Meditation keeps me calm and collected. Today my instacart delivery person dropped off my groceries on the wrong floor. And that made me hella pissed. Like. I can't believe that I got groceries shopped and delivered and I had to spend 15 minutes texting a guy and then walk up three flights of stairs to get the groceries that he misplaced. After meditating... looking back that seemed like a such a trivial issue. And it is. But in the moment I was hella emotional and being emotional isn't good. I think things will work out despite being emotional.. but it's generally better to meditate and be calm. It lets you make the most rational choice which generally is the best choice.

***tl;dr - emotions pretty much never help. meditate and stay calm***
