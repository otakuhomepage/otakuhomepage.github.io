I just got back from the gym after not going for about a week. And I've already lost about 10% of my strength. I can't tell if getting weaker is because of lack of sleep, poor food, and work stress or simply not working out. I'm guessing it's probably a combination of both. I wonder how badly your skills deteriorate over time. I mean... it can't be 10% weaker every week can it? That would mean that a one month vacation would take me to 65% strength. That's kinda a scary thought... but then I actually think I observed that happening that one summer that I went back to Toronto.

But then what about skills like cycling, skiing or playing the piano? I haven't touched a piano in the longest time and now I'm kinda scared to try and play piano again. I'm sure that I'll pick it up quick though. I just thought of this because... it means that I can't alawys be peak ability / the best that I've ever been if this is the case. Or... can I? Well... I guess I can't. Since in order to advance and practice in one area.. you need to spend less time doing other things. I've been focusing a lot on Software Engineering. Hmm. I think I should focus on uh... investing and learning the stock market. But then... what will I need to give up?
