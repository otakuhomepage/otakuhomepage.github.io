So... I think I might be crazy or have ocd / paranoia. Actually I'm not crazy... because I read in a book or saw a ted talk that said once a psychologist labels you as crazy... you can't prove yourself to be sane since you'll be labelled as crazy. I guess... anyone can be crazy depending on how you look at it but I digress.

Anyways... I woke up to a knock on my door. It's the repairman to check my bathroom because it's apparently leaking water. I let him in and he does his thing. He tells me he'll come back later and he has the keys to my place. I'm like sure. Cool cool. On my way out... he's outside my door and he's like cool. Just leave it unlocked and I'll fix your shit. Don't worry I'll lock your door since I have your keys.

So I just left with the door open. And uh... for most of the morning I was thinking of how he'd rob me. And I'd lose like... $5000 worth of goods in my place. I have a lot of electronics. But honestly... if I did lose everything and I had to spend 5k to buy all my shit... it wouldn't really affect me that much. I think the most valueable thing that I have is actually my data. As in the data on my laptop and desktop. But even that... most of it is in the cloud and recoverable.

I think this goes back to minimalism. The more stuff you own... the more attached and fearful you are of losing it? So own less shit. Or... I'm just crazy. Like statistically speaking... the chances of me getting specifically robbed are hella low. It would be better for me to not think about it. I blame the media... and my family for always telling me about robbers and dangers which makes me primed and think irrationally and have fear.

Yup. So that's why I'm crazy. I keep thinking random people will rob me. Fearing the robbery even though it's so statistically unlikely and if it happened it wouldn't even be that big of a deal.
