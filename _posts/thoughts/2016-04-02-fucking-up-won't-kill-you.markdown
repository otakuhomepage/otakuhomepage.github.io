Fucking up won't kill you... even if you think it will. So I just finished the colloboration dance competition and uh.. I definitely didn't perform to the best of my abilities. But at the same time... I guess it could've been a lot worse. Although things can always be worse so that's nothing to really be happy about. 

The thing is - fucking up won't ever kill you. So don't worry about fucking up. Honestly, most people probably wouldn't even notice it... because it's hard to notice. So that applies to real life too. If you fuck up in real life. 99.9% of the world won't know you fucked up. So that don't matter. No matter how badly you do... you can always move to a different area and no one will know you.

The other thing is... I think it goes back to the brain and psychology. The lizard brain... thinks fuck ups will kill you. If you tripped when running from a tiger... you dead. But in real life...most fuck ups won't kill you. Failures won't kill you. It's hard to fail to the point of death. But the system that you're programmed with... it's programmed to think that a mistake will cause death. While that was true in the old days, in modern society most mistakes won't kill you.

I think my fear response is probably stronger than most people. So many things are life and death. But in reality - it's not. Don't let the fear or making a mistake prevent you from going after what you want. After all - it won't kill you. Probably.
