Hmmm. It's been awhile since I wrote something. So I'm all settled into the Toronto vacation mode.

And something that's... always been a bad habit of mine just happened. It's good that I'm aware of it... I guess that's step 1... but I still mess up.

Whenever people tell me to do something.... even if it's something that I want to do or was going to do anyways.... it makes me not want to do it. Kinda like. Fuck you. stop telling me what to do. Urgh.

So I'm living with my parents and spend a lot of time with my grandparents recently. Since the main reason I came back was to spend time with them. They keep telling me to exercise, and watch less stuff on my cell phone etc. And it's things that I was gonna do anyways. Since I was planning on spending my year off just working out and playing video games. But like... blargh. Whenever people tell me what to do it just drives me nuts.

Hmmm. Dunno why. I've been reading the inner game of tennis recently and it's quite the read. It's like... describing what's been happening to me when I try too hard. Whenever you focus too much on the results... (winning) you put a damper on your ability. I guess it is just all about having fun.

From now on whenever people tell me to do something I'll program myself to say: thanks but never tell me what to do again. I don't need your advice since it's something that I already know. Unless it's actually something new and useful. New and useful advice is few and far inbetween. It's basically junk and rehash and shit that I already know. Sigh. I guess I'm reminded of why I left home in the first place. The thinking that my family has is outdated and not useful for the modern world. Maybe I'll write about that more in another post.
