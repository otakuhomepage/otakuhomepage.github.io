I think a new environment just time binds you to the max. I just went for about a one hour walk and it feels much longer than... what I'm normally use to. It normally takes me about an hour for me to walk from SF to say City Dance Studio but then it feels really fast. Today just walking from my future apartment to my share house took about an hour. But it felt much longer. I think it has to do with the fact that everything is unfamiliar and new. It's like... your brain has to slow down to process everything so it feels like time is going slower.

The thing that's so different about walking in Japan is. There are kids everywhere. And old people. And police on bicycles. I think one of the main differences is in SF downtown... it's filled with Dinks(Dual Income No Kids) and generally old people don't live in SF? The case with Toronto is I feel that you need a car to travel and old people definitely don't walk. So it's like kids and old people are a rare sighting. Here in Japan it's so common. I think it might have to do with the density. It's like... with the huge amount of population you just have a magnitude more kids and old people. 14 million vs 800k. That's like... 15x. So before there would be one baby. Now there's 15. Before there would be one old person... now there's 15. Plus the visibility so I guess it makes sense.
