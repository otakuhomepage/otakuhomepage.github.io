Oh man. There were roaches in my new place. Japanese roaches are fucking huge. When they walk... they are so fat that you can heart their footsteps. It's like rats man. And they move so fast. Suffice to say that I am not a fan of roaches. They freak me out. But when a roach invades my home and I live all alone... I gotta kill it or... pretty much I gotta kill it. Blargh. So brutal. So basically I stared at the roach for 20 minutes... and it wouldn't move. And then I started spraying it with lens cleaner and chasing it around. Finally it ran under clear wrapping paper since I have a lot of new furniture... and then I squashed it. 

Gross. It's guts were smeared on my floor. And then... I had to clean up it's guts that were stuck to my floor. I almost borderline puked. Maybe I should've gotten a roomate... or a designated bug killer. I didn't think roaches would exist on the 3rd floor. Gonna go buy some gloves so that I can deal with it in the future more easily. Gotta equip yourself for the job.

But holy crap man. It's so gross. Blargh. I wish there was a roach guy you could call. Man. I feel like... that guy the comedian Louis CK. When he called 911 for a bat. I was pretty much instinctively gonna scream. And then people would be like WTF are you getting murdered or robbed?! Nope. A cockroach. Bleh. So gross. Sigh. Now I'm paranoid. It ruied my sleep. I kept waking up in the middle of the night even though... I told myself that roaches won't kill me. Fear factor style. But the fear is like... subconscious. Or like... animal. I feel like it's the lizard brain.

Anyways... once I get the gloves and the spray. I gotta make a cockroach barrier to protect myself. My first amazon shipment has arrived so now I actually have a chair to sit on. Buying a bedframe is so hard. I want something from Nitori.... but their site is in pure Japanese... I know that I can handle it. But it's just... a hassle. Amazon doesn't have a decent bedframe. Which is surprising. Tokyo game show is tomorrow. I'm excited. Excepted I'm down to my last two t shirts. My washing machine is supposed to arrive tonight. I gotta set it up.

I built an office chair... it was easy as lego and I feel pretty badass. Now I need to get a bed frame and stuff. I still need to fix my internet properly. I got a router and so I'm now connected on all my devices... but then I don't think I fully registered properly since they require a phone number and it doesn't accept an international number. Blargh. Now I gotta call customer support later and talk to him in broken Japanese. 

Well. They played YUI. Good-bye days in Daiso the 100yen shop. Also Yui was played when I had... tempura for dinner. So. Life is pretty good. I'll never get bored of jpop being played in public places I don't think.
