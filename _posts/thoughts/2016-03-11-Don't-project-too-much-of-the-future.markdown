I just got my saturday back. Woot. Woot.

I think... it's good to plan for the future and imagine what it'll be like. But at the same time the future is unpredictable and no point in projecting too much success or failure. Plan but don't project too much. I was all like - life sucks cause I gotta work 3 weekends in a row. But now I got my saturday back. So I only have to work 2 weekends with one week break in between. Life is good.
