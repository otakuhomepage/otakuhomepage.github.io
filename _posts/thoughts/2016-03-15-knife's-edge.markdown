I think to experience the most growth... you really got to be pushing you limits and standing on knife's edge. The thing though... while that gives you the most gains... it's always the most dangerous. One misstep and you'll pay a pretty big price. I experienced the price previously when I kinda got really burned out at work.

I never make the same mistake twice. Well... not never. Generally not. Unless the mistake is trivial or doesn't bring enough pain. Suffice to say that I don't think I'll ever burn out from working a software job. Probably. So my thought today is... I think that the knife's edge isn't actually that good. Well. It's great for as long as you can stand flawlessly on it... until you get a hurt real bad. Then you need to recover. I think it might be safer and better to just go for the smaller gains. The smaller consistent gains compound and maybe it'll be worth it. Probably will be.

I think... the previous method that I used to push myself to the limit. It's like... running like the hare. Or basically... big steps forward and small steps back. But maybe continous small steps forward is the way to go. On the other hand... the big steps prepare you for the big jumps... which you need to take. If you only consistently take small steps forward. Sure you'll go far. But to the guy who can do mega jumps. You probably won't ever catch up.

I guess it's a balance of big jumps and small steps. You always want the small steps forward... but you wanna train yourself to be able to do the big jump. And recover from possible injury of the big jump.
