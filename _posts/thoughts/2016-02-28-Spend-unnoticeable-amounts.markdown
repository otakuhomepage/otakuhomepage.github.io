This is my own personal take on the [maxim](http://www.maxims.us/spend-unnoticeable-amounts/).

I think this is totally true and it's what helps you save money without really planning for it. I've been trying to save up for this trip and the way I've been saving up is by just spending only amounts that I know that I don't need to keep track of or will affect any sort of my financial planning.

Since I first started working... it was about $30... but now that I'm more senior and getting paid more I can afford to spend more on stupid shit and not care about it... and yet I'm still saving more compared to before. I think it's a combination of spending a small fraction of your income to the point where it doesn't really affect you.

I've read a lot of advice that says always save x% before you take money out for yourself... and I think that with this method you can save a much higher x% if you follow it.
