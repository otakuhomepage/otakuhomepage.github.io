I did a crazy task today which was unblock this other team that was missing data. And the work to do it would've taken teams of people but I hacked it and now I feel badass. I think... I might have wrote about it but no biggie. Repetition is practice and reading it again will make you better. There's always a problem or goal. And you should just do whatever it is that helps you accomplish your goal. Don't worry about doing it the 'proper' way. 

It reminds me of the street fighter book on winning. There's no such thing as cheap. There's only winning or losing. If your strategy works against you're opponent even if it's not officially viable or you feel dirty doing it. Just do it and win. WHen it comes to solving problems and reaching goals. Do whatever is the least amount of work necessary to achieve what you want. I actually didn't complete the task today, but I managed to do enough so that I unblocked the other team.

I think it goes back to being an effective engineer. You want to do the least amount of work possible and get the most output in terms of work. But when it comes to real life... you still want to do the least to get the most. Unless it's working out or stuff where you can't really optimize as much and you literally need practice / putting in the hours.

***tl;dr - I feel badass an effective because I did the the impossible by focusing on the high leverage activity***
