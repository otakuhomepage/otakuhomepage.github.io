So I just got back from playing magic and I got crushed. I tried to build a 4 color deck in 4 booster draft. And uh. It didn't work at all. The thing is... trying to play 4 colors is way too hard and way to diverse. If you don't get the lands and have mismatched cards. You basically can't play anything. At one point I was holding 8 cards and had to discard. This happened 3 turns in a row. It's like... when you try to do too many things... you end up being unable to do anything because you never have enough.

I already know and most people agree that multitasking is a scam. Whenever there's an article or lifehack on how to multi-task in my mind I'm like - this guy is retarded. Or the author is retarded. Because multi-tasking is a scam. When someone tells me their good at multi tasking... it's just like. Uhhh...? Okay.

Anyways. Trying too many things is bad. Let me give some more examples. At the office we have street fighter 5. And.. everyone that plays wants to try all the characters. Or.. they try to learn one character. Give up. And then end up learning another. But then they can never get past a certain level because they don't focus on one character. Blargh. Focus on one character and get better. Then it'll translate to other characters as well.

I don't get why people read multiple books at once and have a book ongoing. Or the same thing with video games. I think that just detracts from the enjoyment of the game or book. Plus you tend to forget since you've been focused on other stuff. Well. For some video games I guess it's okay if it's like dynasty warriors, and devil may cry or something. But for most games that would be bad. Yeah. I think I'm beating a zombie horse at this time.

***tl;dr - don't play too many colors in magic. Don't try too many things in real life. Focus and dedication brings results***
