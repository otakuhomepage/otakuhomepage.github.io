I think everyone agrees that sleep is really important. I just wanted to write down some of my personal experiences on sleep that has really messed me up.

First a short side story since I really want to talk about the time I did the uberman sleep cycle. I did the uberman sleep cycle for about a month in college. It wasn't that hard since I lived in a secluded and quiet place and I skipped 95% of my classes anyways. I remember it well... I would sleep every 4 hours from 12. So 12/4/8 am/pm. Getting on the schedule was a real pain. My body would always feel cold like it was shutting down or something. But then... at some point in time... it started working. Every 25 minute sleep for me... was a lucid dream. That was mind blowingly amazing. It's like... whoa. And then... I started having all this extra time. And sometimes... depending on the nap / time of the nap. I would have 3.5 hours of like peak mental performance. I even went to the gym and yoga during the uberman. Because 3.5 hours isn't that short. 

I kinda miss being able to sleep whenever and wake whenever. It's pretty amazing. I think that I have... a natural sleep rhythem that's longer than 24 hours. So I end up staying up later and later and waking up later and later to the point it's a whole new day. Since I've been on vacation... I've been following the sleep when tired and wake when good schedule. But then I'm trying to get ready for work... at waking up at 11am is so hard. I've been trying to go to bed at 3am... and I don't really get to sleep. Blargh.

So the other day (Monday) I knew that I had yoga at 1pm. 1pm is quite late... so I figured I'd be able to sleep at 5am and then life would be good. But when I went to sleep at 5am... I couldn't sleep. Blargh. And then when my alarm went off at 12:20. I was soooooo tired. I really *really* wanted to go to yoga class. The monday yoga instructor is my favorite yoga instructor by far. I feel so zen and calm after going to her classes. And even though I woke up... even though I really wanted to go. I ended up sleeping. I guess... lack of sleep is like... the worse.

In my mind... there's so much that I want to write on sleep. I think the crux of it is that lack of sleep actually leaves me with close to no mental energy / willpower. I stop going to the gym. I start eating junk food and chocolate. I stop meditating. Lack of sleep just wrecks all my good habits. Okay. Feeling tired so I'm just gonna sleep now. This has been a good practice in writing even though my writing and thoughts are so unstructured.
