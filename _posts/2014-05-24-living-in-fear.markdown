<p>I've finally got around to setting my blog. It's hooked up to twitter and shit and then I realize that I'm scared to write. Fear has been holding me back from so many things. I'm not sure why I have so much fear....</p>
<p>It's not like I hide who I am. For some reason I've just always had the fear that having a blog about my hobbies on anime and video games would affect my job opportunities and what not.. but I know that it isn't the case. After all, I tell them I play a bunch of video games and stuff in the interview.</p>
<p>I know that there'll always be haters and in anything worth doing. haha. To be honest, I don't think people I know will ever find my blog. Most people only care about themselves, so I don't think people give a shit about what I write online.</p>
<p>Despite that, I'm scared. Blargh. Well, taking action despite fear is good right.</p>
<p>tl;dr - take action despite fear</p>
