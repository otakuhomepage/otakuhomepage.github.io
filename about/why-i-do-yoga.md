I've been doing yoga for slightly over a year now. I only do it once a week. I've been meaning to add more but I keep making excuses for myself. Here are the main points why I enjoy doing yoga and why you should try it out too.

**Going at your own pace -** Yoga is all about going at your own pace and not comparing yourself to others. This is one of the points that makes yoga so helpful and fun for me. I try to bring this into my life as much as possible. It honestly doesn't matter what your peers are doing, or what others are doing. It's important to know what you want and go at your own pace.

**Judgment free environment** - Yoga is pretty much judgment free. I suck at it and no one laughs at me or anything. I don't judge people who are worse than me. Everyone in class is just trying to do their best. I think it just made me more conscious of when I do judge people. I catch myself doing it and then I just stop.

**Accepting your limits while pushing yourself -** You shouldn't force yourself to do things that you cannot do. It just doesn't work. Yoga is all about accepting your limits while still pushing yourself to improve and work. You are who you are, but you can work towards being better.

**Process oriented -** Yoga is the perfect example of process driven. Each practice session is like laying a brick to building an amazing wall or something. One day you'll suddenly be able to do crazy shit. For me this happened when one day I could suddenly do the crow pose. Too crazy. Now, I just show up to do my yoga practice... and patiently wait for the day I can do the magical handstand.

**Meditation and mind chatter -** I'm kind of scared to write this since I might get diagnosed with being a crazy person. But there's this voice inside my head that just keeps talking and distracting me from doing things sometimes. I think some books referring to it as the mind brain vs chatter brain? Or I'm crazy. After doing yoga, it helps calm down my that voice inside my head.

**Health benefits -** I originally started doing yoga because of my posture. As an otaku and software engineer, I use the computer 10+ hours per day and play video games way to much. Yoga has increased my flexibility and helped out with my posture quite a bit.

**tl;dr - try out yoga. it's awesome**
