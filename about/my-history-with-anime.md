<p>Growing up in Canada of course I watched a ton of YTV. My first few animes were definitely DBZ, Gundam Wing, Vision of Escaflowne and Yugioh. Good times.</p>
<p>I didn't really get into anime until high school when a friend introduced me to Naruto. This was when there was ~90 episodes of Naruto out. Holy shit, so long ago. Anyways, I started watching the subbed version of Naruto and the Chuunin Exam Arc was just so amazing. Even now, I think that's one of my favorite arcs of all time regarding anime.</p>
<p>From Naruto, I moved onto Bleach and then starting reading the manga for both. Around this time was when Death Note was still ongoing, and I decided to not read or watch it until it was done. Death note is definitely one of my top 10 manga and animes.</p>
<p>With Naruto as the gateway, I started watching Full Metal Alchemist. Rewrite is possibly the greatest opening anime song of all time. Full Metal Alchemist lead to <strong>Full Metal Panic</strong> and all three panic series. There was also School Rumble and Ouran High School Host Club. I guess when you're in high school, high school animes are really relevant and interesting. </p>
<p>I also watched Inuyasha and Prince of Tennis because Inuyasha had really good music that I liked and because I played tennis back then. My friend told me about a bread baking show Yakitate! Japan and it's like the most funniest and best anime ever. About baking bread. #otaku</p>
<p>High school was so easy. I remember the school agenda saying time for homework was suppose to be ~5 hours but honestly on average it probably took an hour. I watched Kenshin, Samurai Deeper Kyo, Samurai Champloo. And the old school Hunter X Hunter. I really want to bold Hunter X Hunter, but... the 2011 version isn't complete yet and I only want to bold completed animes. Fate Stay Night was really good, except I was really sad how Archer died. And Shirou annoyed me so much. But damn, Unlimited Blade Works!</p>
<p>There was of course Gundam Seed, and Gundam Seed Destiny. I'm pretty into mecha. I also enjoyed Gundam 00.</p>
<p>In University I started playing dota which was distracted me from my anime watching time but I still managed to keep up with the most popular and cool series. Like <strong>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann </strong>and <strong>>Code Geass. </strong>Also there was the remake of <strong>Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood </strong>which was so much better.&nbsp; I remember picking up One Piece during exam week and then watching 300+ episodes and reading 100+ chapters to catch up. This was right around the point of the Rescue Ace arc, I was so shocked when he died. :(</p>
<p>One of my characters is Yagami Light from death note. And the voice actor that voices him is instantly recognizable to me because he also voiced Lelouch in Code Geass, and the Mad Scientist in <strong>Steins; Gate</strong>. Steins; Gate was definitely one of the best animes in 2011 and 2012 or whatever. <strong>Fate Zero </strong>is so good. The animation and the story. Iskandar is so manly.</p>
<p>I'm going through the list of bolded animes, and there's exactly 10 Keikaku doori. I would most definitely recommend because I consider them to the the best that I've seen and I've seen a lot.</p>
<p>I've bolded my top 10 animes as I was writing this so I can revisit for the future... Eventually I'll get around to writing a complete list of all the animes that I've watched... eventually. So many.</p>
