<p>I think it's important to try out new things. I've been meaning to try out Pilates for the longest time, but I never got around to it because work was always so busy and I never actually planned for it to happened. So this week I actually planned and made sure I showed up to Pilates.</p>
<p>The experience was really interesting because... the whole time I was feeling out of it, tired, and lazy. I still did my best to follow the class though. I don't know when, but at some point I started getting cramps in both my legs and feet. I think it's because I didn't flex my feet and I was trying to point my feet like other people. Anyways, the cramps were really bad and I had to take a break while everyone was doing stuff... the instructor came by to check up on me.</p>
<p>I guess my experience of Pilates is that it's ridiculously hard and it gives you cramps. But I'm really glad I tried it.. and I think I might try and go for more Pilates class in the future. In a way, Pilates reminds me of when I first started Yoga. I remember having cramps doing Yoga and not being able to do any of the poses. Even now when I do Yoga, I'll start to feel like I'm cramping up but then I adjust and stretch it out before it gets worse.</p>
<p>I'm actually surprised by the level of fitness of people in Yoga &#47; Pilates. It makes me feel like I'm weak and out of shape. I can barely hold plank position for more than 30 seconds. At this point I have no idea what I'm talking about.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - tried out pilates. got cramps in first day of pilates. will probably go again in order to improve my flexibility<&#47;strong></p>
