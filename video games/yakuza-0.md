I finished Yakuza 0 recently. It was a pretty good Japanese learning experience. I got quite a lot better at reading. There are times I can out-read the voice acting. Which makes me feel badass. Anyways. First a review of the game followed by an in-depth plot/translation/analysis by me. Of course the plot part will be pure spoilers.

Gameplay wise... it's pretty much same series. The thing that I really didn't enjoy was the fetch quests for homeless people and protecting the retard. There's this part of the game where you need information from the homeless... and they all have esoteric alcoholic tastes. You can't buy all the booze from the same place. And there isn't a minimap guide for where to buy the booze. You basically gotta remember what each homeless person wanted and search the town for shops that sell it. Since I'm illiterate... that was extra hard. Cause kanji all look so similar. The other part that I really didn't like was protecting the retard quest. I mean. I get the protect quest... but if you were being attacked by yakuza... you wouldn't stand in the fucking middle of the room. At least hide in the fucking corner. Blargh. That pissed me off so much. 

The thing that I did like is that they fused the money/skill upgrade system into one. Basically, you upgrade your skills with money and you buy shit with money. This made me much less hesitant to spend my money. Since I could buy all the healing items in the world... or upgrade 5% of skill. The battle system introduced uh... 3 fight styles per character. I basically only stuck to the initial style. Since... I feel that the initial style is probably the most balanced / best. It feels like the 3 styles were basically speed/power/balance. And of course balance is best. I couldn't read all the skills I was getting... so I mostly just got health upgrades and went through the game unupgraded. No biggie.

Another complaint is... fucking guns. Especially towards the end. You basically have to fight people with guns. And it's fucking retarded. They shoot you... you lose a shit ton of life... AND you got stunned for 1 second. Which is an eternity. The other thing about the combat system that I didn't like is that you get knocked down way to quickly. Small fry knock you down in like 3 hits. Sigh. That's just annoying. Whenever you get knocked down. Overall though... I'd say this game is... the usual Yakuza experience. I need to work on my Japanese so that I can enjoy the hostess parts of the game though. =|

You know what's weird though? I always thought the English translation was bad... or subpar. Because the boss fights would be like. Yeah. I'll beat the shit outta you. Or... If you beat me up I'll tell you whatever you want. And... that's like... the actual literal Japanese from the original game. Like... you meet this guy... and it's like... tell me the info. Nope. Let's fight. Okay then. If you beat the shit outta me... I promise I'll tell only the truth. Now.... let's fight yo. O.O""". Just weird.... it's so literal.

Now... it's time for the Alan plot translation. I may have misinterpreted the plot... but whatever. Deal with it.

~~~Major Spoilers Below~~~

The game starts with Kiryu beating the shit outta some guy and then taking money that was owed. He brings it to some rich guy in a limo and the guy's like. Keep the money. Take some extra. I only made you do it to uphold my reputation. Then... the next day... the guy is dead. Kiryu is now wanted for murder. He brings shame to his yakuza family.

So he quits the gang. He's sad and alone when suddenly some guy approaches him. Tachibana. Tachibana said his adopted father referred him to the job. So then he becomes a company man. The company is after a piece of land. It'll be the centerpiece of the new Kamiurcho? Shit... I should know how to prounouce the city. Tachibana tells him about this piece of land. Kiryu researches it and ends up meeting Tachibana again. Tachibana tells Kiryu the referral and the link between them. Kiryu's step/yakuza father recommended him for the job. So Kiryu becomes a salaryman and works for Tachibana. Cut to... Majima.

Majima Goro... my favorite character in the series. He's the manager of the grand. Which is a nightclub. He's the king of the night. He was banished by the gang for betraying his boss because he wanted to protect his brother. Now he's just working as a slave as a night club owner. But... there's a chance for him to rejoint the gang. All he has to do is kill Makimura Makoto. Easy peasy.

Goes to the massage place. No one is there. Meets a cute blind girl. Hmmmm... doesn't look yakuza. Gets a massage. The tencho comes back and a fight ensues. Gangsters come looking for Makimura Makoto... turns out the girl is Makoto. O.O. Majima ends up saving the girl instead of killing her.
