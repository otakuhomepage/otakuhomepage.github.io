<p>I was supposed to go on a Thanksgiving road trip to Oregon for 4 days, but it never happened. Instead I decided to finally finish Bioshock Infinite. I'm really thankful that I did.</p>
<p>This game has been on my to play list for over 1.5 years. I finally finished it last weekend. It was so freaking amazing. Especially the ending. I really like games &#47; shows where shit just spikes in intensity towards the end such that you *need* to know &#47; finish the game.</p>
<p>I don't feel like I should comment on the gameplay much since I played it on PC with a trainer. I had infinite ammo &#47; hp. I tried playing it without the cheats but found it just a bit too tedious for me. Even though I was playing it on newbie mode. I think my fps skills have deteriorated from lack of use. Also I'm currently playing with a left handed mouse and I haven't trained my left hand in the art of fps. Only Starcraft. I digress.</p>
<p>So I have the Radeon 7850 1 gb and it let me play the game at pretty much the max settings at 1080p. The game looked *gorgeous*. This brings me back to the day when Bioshock 1, first came out. I remember Bioshock 1 because that's when I built my first computer with the 2900 XT. I was blown away by how amazing the PC game looked. The water in the beginning of Bioshock 1. Man, such amazing real water. Nostalgia.</p>
<p>Bioshock Infinite has amazing graphics on the PC. Asides from the beautiful graphics, it's really cool that your sidekick &#47; person you're suppose to protect is not retarded &#47; invulnerable. Most of the game you'll be traveling with Elizabeth, and during fights she'll actually *hide* instead of running around and dying. Of course, I think she's invulnerable, so that's also good.</p>
<p>The only downside I guess is that I kinda miss some of the old school vigors (magic). I don't think I found telekinesis, which is the gravity gun. The audiotapes are so much fun. As you're exploring and you find the audiotapes, and then the story gradually unfolds through each person telling their part of the story.</p>
<p>Story: 10&#47;10<br />
Characters: 10&#47;10<br />
Music: 8&#47;10<br />
Gameplay: 8&#47;10<br />
Overall: 9&#47;10</p>
