Since I read think and grow rich as a kid... there's something that I've always been meaning to do which is program my subconscious. The instructions below are how to use the app in order to program your subconscious.

Every morning you should read your mantra aloud. It's important that you start with I. It's also important that you read it out loud. After trying it out for myself... the difference between reading it out loud vs reading it mentally is night and day. So read it out loud and be sure to include the I.

The other part of this app is to be able to send messages to yourself. You can talk to yourself via the app. The purpose of this is to see if you're inner voice is getting better. Growing up... I would always have a negative inner voice. You can't do it. It'll be hard. Or go fuck yourself. I would probably only tell few people in the world to go fuck themselves... and yet I'd tell myself that pretty easily. Weird right?

The last part is there can be hourly / preset messages at intervals. Once again it's important that you read it out aloud. By default I've made it so all of my messages are imported. You can edit and delete these messages according to your own needs.
