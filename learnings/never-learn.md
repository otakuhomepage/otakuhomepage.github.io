<p>So one of my favorite JJ Lin songs of all time - <a title="Never Learn" href="https://www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=27R6ZavdzzQ" target="_blank">Never Learn</a></p>
<p>I've been listening to this song a lot. I'm think it applies so much to me in a sense that I feel that in certain areas I just don't learn. I'm insane. I keep doing the same things over and over again expecting different results. Or rather, I know what I *should* be doing but I choose to ignore it.</p>
<p>When I look at myself from an engineering &#47; technical perspective. I have an amazing growth mindset and I grow at a rapid pace. Compared to a year ago today, I am such a stronger engineer. In a year I've learned Android &#47; iOS &#47; Python and a shit town of system administrations. Plus I just code much more solidly now - so to speak.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that they should exercise more, eat more healthy, etc. You *know* this but you don't do it. It's really funny for me because I *know* the correct answer or the correct action. Yet - I choose to sabotage myself. There are things that I know on a fundamental level - yet I just never learn. It's like I know touching the stove will burn me. But I just keep touching the stove. Or... I what I *should* be doing and yet I just don't do it. Blargh.</p>
<p>In my case it's just a lot of self sabotage. It feels like whenever I'm close to success I like to stop and screw myself over. I've been working on various side projects like otakuhomepage.com. It's been ready. I've been working on this product is all planned out and shit and just needs a few more finishing touches before release. I know that I *should* be releasing it. And yet... I'm stalling. I'm putting the brakes out of fear...? I don't even know what it is.</p>
<p>I don't want to say that I feel I'm stuck. Because I know that I'm not. I'm aware of the fact that I keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. I also know what I need to do. My brain keeps telling me what to do - I just choose to shoot myself in the foot. blargh. I think in my subconscious.... I just never learn. Even though that's not the case. If I were to measure myself compared to a year ago. All my stats have improved and all my actions are better.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - don't be insane. i hope you aren't like me and never learn. know the right thing. do the right thing.</strong></p>
