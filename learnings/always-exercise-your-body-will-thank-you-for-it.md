<p>This is something that I still struggle with to this day event though I exercise on a semi regular basis. Last night was Thursday night and I normally designate Thursday and Sunday as my work out days.</p>
<p>I kept making up excuses to not go to the gym. I'm out of milk so I can't have a proper protein shake. I'm stressed out from doing job interviews. I'm sleep deprived so I should sleep earlier instead of going to the gym. Rationalizations and excuses just kept coming up. But then I guess I've built the habit of working out quite strongly that I convinced myself to simply walk to the gym.</p>
<p>Just walk to the gym, I told myself. Then you can walk right back. But of course when I got there I figured I might as well try working out. Damn, I didn't feel like running at all... just get on the treadmill I managed to convince myself. I'm running at a slow 5 mph and then I slowly bring it up to 6 mph. My feet felt like they weighed one ton each. Everything just felt so hard. My self talk was like: some beats none. Good job even getting on the treadmill. Even though your feet feels like one ton each, you definitely able to run at 6 mph and even faster. Then I started doing interval training at 8 and 10 minutes. I only did two intervals as opposed to my typical 4&#47;5 but it didn't matter. I showed up to the gym and I got on the treadmill and that's all that matters.</p>
<p>Then down at the weight room... I was starting to feel good. My body was feeling good despite it being tired and drenched in sweat. I did my usual 5x5 workout except I was lifting way less than my max. I guess I just wanted to take it easy, but I still did 5 sets. Afterwards, my body actually felt great. I think my energy levels went up and at night I slept really well.</p>
<p>I guess this goes back to doing shit you don't feel like. I think the main lesson is you need to internalize or establish a really simple habit. In my case, this habit is just walking into the gym. Every Thursday and Sunday I'll walk myself over to the gym. If I just walk over and walk back home... I'll have walked one mile and life will be good. But of course, usually when I show up at the gym I end up getting a solid workout and everything is good.</p>
<p>Instead of establishing a new hard to follow routine, I guess the takeaway is start really small and make the habit really easy to do. It's easy for me to show up. I must just show up and life is good. I guess that's why group exercise classes work so well. You just show up. And then you'll do what you gotta do and feel amazing.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - always exercise. make your routine really easy to do and something that you *must* do</strong></p>
