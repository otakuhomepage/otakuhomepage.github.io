<p>So I just watched the documentary of sick, fat and nearly dead. This was after me watching a documentary on the current food industry and how addictive our processed foods are. I guess it's true, fast food is addictive like a drug. And so is sugar. I think once you start eating that crap, you just start to crave it even though you know that it's bad for you.</p>
<p>There was quite a bit of information in the two films, but it all boils down to the fact that not all calories are equal. If you have 2000 calories of junk vs 2000 calories of real food you'll have different energy levels and different levels of fullness. I think the reason that I'm always so hungry is because my body is craving certain nutrients that I haven't been providing it. It also explains why my energy levels are occasionally zapped beyond explanation. Even though I eat somewhat healthy and exercise... I think I'm still missing something.</p>
<p>I'm going to do a juice cleanse. It'll happen after I've secured my next place of employment. I'm planning on doing the juice cleanse for a week. Then afterwards I'll see how it goes. I plan on having the juice as a meal replacement for breakfast. Since my breakfast right now consists of either chocolate, cookies, bread, or nothing. A nice glass of juice is bound to do me good.</p>
<p>Plus, I need to start tracking my physical stats. I know that I've gotten fatter and weaker, but no numbers to back it up. Something that I've always thought of was that obese people are lazy and whatever.. and that if I ever got fat I'd be able to easily lose the weight. I'm not as convinced of that after watching the documentary... because after all the food is so addicting. Then again, I'm certain that since other people have lost weight after being fat, I'd be able to do it too.&nbsp; There's nothing that others have done that I cannot do. Well, pretty much nothing... I still can't touch my toes after two years of yoga. I'm wondering if that's a mental limitation... and not a physical one.</p>
<p>I'm actually excited to try the juice fast because I need to eat healthier. I've been stressed out with work and job searching and as a result have been eating more unhealthy and just eating more crap. I don't know what I was trying to get from writing this but... moral of the story is juice cleanse for a week incoming to test. Followed by juice breakfast to eliminate junk that I consume.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - exercise and eat healthy people</strong></p>
