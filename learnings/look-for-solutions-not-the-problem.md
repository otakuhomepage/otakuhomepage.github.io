<p>I always talk about my poor thought process being raised in an Asian family and what not - and this thought occurred to me which is that we should look for solutions and not the problem.</p>
<p>When you look at the problem - it actually doesn't do jack in most cases. Some examples that come to mind is my poor posture I guess. Growing up, my parents would always yell at me for bad posture. The thing wrong with this is that it was reinforcing what was wrong - and it wasn't helping with improving or correcting the issue. All I heard was bad posture repeated to me and my subconscious probably adjusted to have bad posture. Like how positive affirmations allow you to reprogram your subconscious, I think all the bad posture yelling from my parents probably negatively conditioned my subconscious.</p>
<p>Let's say you were overweight and unhealthy. Instead of focusing on the fact that you're overweight and can't run long distances. Or focusing on all the delicious foods that you want to eat (the problem) - try and focus on the solutions. All you have to do is show up and start exercising and eating healthier foods. You don't need to count calories - just exercise daily and eat more fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>The issue I find with focusing on the problems is that not only does it not help - it usually amplifies the problem. Because you think of it as a problem - or a challenge. You're creating difficulty by yourself by labeling it as difficult. Like the famous quote where someone says the person who thinks they can and a person who thinks they can't are often right. When you think it's hard - it'll be hard. So don't think that it'll be hard - and don't focus on the problem.</p>
<p>By focusing on the solution you get yourself moving in the right direction and taking action. One problem that I had before was just playing video games. I played a *lot* of video games. It's not that playing video games is bad per say, but I was wasting a lot of time. I kept thinking of all the video games that I wanted to play. But it's so much more important to focus on what the solution is. In my case - it was having more time to do other things such as reading and working on side projects. So now I make sure to read at least 1 hour per day, and work on my projects twice a week. It's a small solution - but it moves me forward and since then I've been cutting down on wasted time. When I do play video games, it's amazingly fun and I don't have to feel guilty.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - look for solutions. focusing on the problem doesn't help and makes it worse. start small.</strong></p>
