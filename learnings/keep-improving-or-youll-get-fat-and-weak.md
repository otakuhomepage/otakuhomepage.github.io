<p>I had almost a 3 week vacation. It started out with a week in Anaheim&#47;LA with Disneyland and E3 and it ended with 2 weeks in Toronto eating food, playing video games, watching netflix... and of course coding remotely.</p>
<p>My typical week in San Francisco consists of weights, yoga, bouldering, running, and spinning. I was following the stronglifts 5x5 workout and progressing pretty well. Then after my 3 weeks of vacation... I got back and I undid 5 weeks worth of 5x5. It's really sad, but it shows that when you ain't getting better then you be getting worse.</p>
<p>I guess progress is slow but destroying progress is fast. That's the takeaway that I'm getting. Or maybe the fact that it's all about going in the net positive direction. I guess 6 days forward and 1 day back isn't the same as 5 weeks forward and 2 weeks free fall. Don't let yourself free fall. That's the takeaway.</p>
<p>I guess everything has to be conscious and in control. I actually let myself talk like a crazy person during vacation. You know how people say I'm gonna go to the gym later so I can have this 500 calorie snack? I was that person... even though rationally speaking - I know that's retarded. It was vacation so all the shit that I was eat - doesn't count. blargh. that was stupid. 2nd take away: don't talk like a stupid person. Everything counts... even on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - I lost 5 weeks of work out progress due to 3 weeks of 'vacation' gg.</strong></p>
