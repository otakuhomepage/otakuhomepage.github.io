<p>This weekend I didn't really get much work done. I was suppose to write some new pages on my top 10 favorite animes and I ended up not doing it. Before I had this site up, I imagined how much fun it would be writing about my favorite animes and recommending it to people, because I find that so much fun to do in real life.</p>
<p>As the site became functional and I started w4riting a couple of pages on my favorite animes... somewhere along the lines writing new articles became an objective... and work. Since it became work, for some reason I just don't feel like doing it. I rather spend time watching Starcraft 2 or playing Vindictus. Side note: I wasted probably 12 hours in Vindictus this weekend... blargh. I don't even find that fun or anything.</p>
<p>I think that the reason that I play Vindictus, and that I put off doing 'work' is because something like Vindictus is very tangible. Video games and mmo reward time spent. Your results is a direct correlation to the amount of time and effort you put in. Whereas stuff like writing a new article on Steins;Gate takes time and effort and google analytics tells me no one is reading it. =&#47;</p>
<p>I need to stop thinking of writing on this site as work. I generally enjoy writing down my thoughts because I find there's a little bit of therapeutic effect to it. Kind of like how some people like to do gardening to relax. That, I'll never get because gardening is gross and tiring.</p>
<p>There's so many things that I take for granted that I think is work but actually isn't. Today, I went to the gym. It felt like work because I had to go.. and stop playing video games and stuff. But going to the gym is so much fun, and I feel great after going. In hindsight, it was fun that I went. When I first started writing this article, it kinda felt like work. But now that I reached this point I realize that once again it's fun. I think it goes back to being thankful and grateful etc. I should be thankful that I get to write and go to the gym and stuff. &#47;shrug.</p>
<p>tl;dr - stop thinking of it as work. it's fun. be glad you get the chance to do it.</p>
