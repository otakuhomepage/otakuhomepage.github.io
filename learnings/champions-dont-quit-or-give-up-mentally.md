<p>I think this is one of my big weakness. Sometimes, I'm just negative. Or I see myself as weak. I tend to give up a bit too quickly. I have idra-like gg timings. I give up on a winnable situation too often. It's something that I'm aware of, and I'm trying to fix.</p>
<p>I just got a fresh dose of it yesterday night. I stayed up to watch the GSL RO4, of soO vs Zest. In my mind, the winner of this ro4 is pretty much going to be the champ. Watching the series live at around 3am, 4am Pacific time and sleepy as hell. And then soO goes down 2-0. Then he manages to win a game, and I'm like nice... he didn't crack yet. But then game 4, he goes down 3-1 and then looking at the booth he looks almost shaken. In my mind, I guess I would've given up. Hell, I'd given up on soO. I was definitely cheering for him.. and as a fan I'd given up before he'd even finished losing. This morning, the first thing I did was check the score after waking up. soO won. 4-3. He came back from a 1-3 deficit. He had the champion mentality and positivity. In my mind, I knew it was possible. It was still possible for soO to come back. But I didn't want to be disappointed, so I just slept.</p>
<p>I guess I tend to give up easily because I don't want to set myself up for a bigger disappointment. Maybe with more effort and work, the disappointment will also be bigger which is why I tend to give up too soon. I'm aware of it, and I've definitely gotten better at it. I notice myself just be conscious when I do it and I'm almost to the point where I can snap myself out of it and find the positive light.</p>
<p>Winner's don't quit. Winner's don't give up. And winners are always positive and believe in themselves. That's what makes them a champion. I'm stoked to watch the GSL finals and see soO finally win his gold. I feel disappointed. Disappointed that I didn't stick around to watch the comeback of soO. I also feel disappointed when I give up too easily. So from now on I won't give up ~ Jason Mraz.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - think positive. believe in yourself. never quit until you win or die trying</strong></p>
