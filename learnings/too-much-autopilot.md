<p>I feel like recently I've been operating in autopilot mode... which is bad. At work I can't really operate on autopilot because I always ask for increasingly difficult and challenging work which is engaging and forces me to think and work through things. But besides work - I feel like I've activated autopilot... and it fucking sucks.</p>
<p>It's not even that I've blacked out. That would've been scary. But a lot of the times... I don't even remember my commutes. Like my walk from work to home. Sometimes... I just arrive at my doorstep and it's like.. wtf. I got home but it feels like no time has passed. I spaced out and it's as if I teleported home.</p>
<p>When I go out and get food. I don't even remember the walks back. I'm just unconsciously taking the path home... weaving through people... obeying the traffic rules. It's pretty unconscious behavior. You gotta be in the now yo. Eckhart Tolle yo.</p>
<p>The same thing has been happening at the gym or when I do stretches now. It's like... I'll go from set 1 to set 4... and I don't even register it. It's like my body is just doing it on it's own. Pretty scary. And when you're not even conscious and thinking about it... it's easy to forget. Was I on set 2... or set 4? What's next? I'm working out unconsciously, then I'm conscious and it's like shit. What just happened.</p>
<p>What makes us do what we do? I guess we're made by our habits. I need to work on breaking the autopilot. A friend is visiting... and Thanksgiving and Christmas is approaching so it'll give me some break time to reinvent myself and get off the autopilot subconscious stupidness.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - don't go into autopilot and unconsciously live your life. be in the now yo</strong></p>
