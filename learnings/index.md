<p>This is the section that I'll dedicate to my learnings through my experiences or by reading books and articles. I find that I learn better by having to write it out, or by teaching others. This area will be areas to consolidate my learnings and hopefully make other people learn through my experiences or whatever.</p>
<p>As I start writing more and more I'll link the best articles here. As well as the core concepts that's been distilled. I've been keeping a journal of my writings and activities and I'm slowly translating it online.</p>
