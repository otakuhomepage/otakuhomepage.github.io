<p>I was sick today, I woke up with a sore throat because I decided to eat all of my beef stew from yesterday. The beef stew gave me a sore throat, that or my coworkers infected me.</p>
<p>Pretty much all I wanted to do today was to stay home and watch anime. I started sword art online, and damn is it good. My brain does stupid ass things to me. It keeps telling me to do things that I shouldn't do - eat that chocolate cake, lazy around at home.</p>
<p>I think my brain has something against my well being. So I decided to go to boxing class today. That was way harder than I imagined it. Firstly, I think my brain has a crazy fear of the unknown, also it likes to self sabotage me.&nbsp; I just accumulated enough beginner boxing classes to go to the intermediate class and I've been putting off attending the intermediate classes for the longest time. I think it's because of the fear of the unknown. It's something that I haven't done before and outside my comfort zone, which is pure bullshit because I've attended classes in which I started with zero knowledge and whatnot.</p>
<p>I was sick, and my brain kept telling me that I should just take it easy and rest at home. I know that exercise will help me feel better over the sickness. I think that pain and happiness are also not the same. Same thing with pleasure and happiness. Staying home and watching anime and playing video games would've given me pleasure, but it wouldn't have made me happy.</p>
<p>The whole time to boxing I was thinking negative thoughts almost. The walk in the cold to class sucks. The class is so tiring, I'm so tired, I wish I could take it easy. I just kept at it and kept punching, shit I was really tired. But you know what, after class I felt so amazing. I think it's the exercise endorphins talking or the fact that I kicked my brain's ass. Even though me = my brain? There's so much that I want to do that would cause me less enjoyment but bring me great happiness, and I need to keep doing those things. It's hard though, I need to keep working at it.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - do the thing, even when you don't feel like it</strong></p>
