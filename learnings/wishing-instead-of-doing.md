<p>I can't believe I'm falling into the trap of wishing instead of doing... but that's actually been the case since the new years. I've been having a kind of reverse new years resolution in a sense that I've been slacking off from working towards my goals.</p>
<p>I want to become a better Software Engineer and to do that I just need to work, read and build stuff. Being better at Software Engineering doesn't just happen through wishful thinking... you need to put in the work and deliberate practice.</p>
<p>One of my two fitness goals is to be able to do a muscle up. The other is to run a sub 5 minute mile. I actually once reached the level of doing a muscle up about 6 months back... but then I took a vacation and ate junk food and didn't exercise. Now... I can't do a muscle up. :(</p>
<p>I've looked down upon the people who always say things but never do it. Everybody *wants* to lose weight but no one actually goes to the gym to exercise. Everybody *wants* to be rich and wealthy but nobody does any work outside of their work. And recently... I've been just wishing for stuff to happen without taking any action.</p>
<p>I've gotten fatter and weaker and the reason is simple... I've been exercising less and less. Previously, I would go to the gym four of five days a week. And now I'm down to 2 days a week. I also have cut down on the amount of cardio that I've been doing. Running two miles today actually took so much out of me that I was feeling nauseous.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - stop wishing for things and start taking action towards realizing them<&#47;strong></p>
