<p>It's all about hard work and consistency. There. The most important thoughts of the week. This was reminded to me today in spin class, and previously at climbing.</p>
<p>Last week I went climbing with my friends at PG SF. I sucked. If I'm going to be completely honestly, it's because I'm out of shape. In addition to be relatively out of shape, my new climbings shoes that I bought online were way too small and it hurt too much. So the shoes were a big negative.</p>
<p>Anyways. At climbing I regressed. I couldn't even do a few of the V1s. My friend who bought a membership and has been going consistently twice a week for about three months... is now a much better climber than me. Back when we first started, she could barely do the V0s and I beasted V2s easily. But now I'm fat and outta shape, and she's beast mode.</p>
<p>The takeaway from climbing is that it's all about consistency. You just keep getting better by putting the the hours. Going twice a week, doing anything twice a week - will make you better at it. Hard work always beats talent. It's too bad Rock Lee never beat Neji... but I guess Neji was a hard worker on top of uber talent. Which makes me sad because I don't have uber talent. </p>
<p>The other thing is that I've been skipping my Sunday workouts for the past two weeks. It's really rare that I miss twice. Because one of my mantra's is the "never miss twice" which is to say that it's fine to miss one workout - but don't miss two workouts etc. I went to spin class today, and the results of me missing my Sunday workout shows... spin class was brutally hard. Even though I was taking it relatively easy... I was feeling a bit light headed. If you ain't moving forward... you're moving backwards I guess. Without consistently moving forward and putting in the work... you'll just be regressing. And sucking.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - always put in the work. consistent hard work overcomes talent.</strong></p>
