<p>I recently vomited... it was really sucky. And I didn't vomit for the longest time because I've been healthy and don't drink. It was a really shitty feeling. But at the same thing I feel can of cathartic. Well.. I was relieved when I finally puked. But a lot of the time I spent feeling like I was gonna puke but then just bleh.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the movie Pitch Perfect weirdly. Of when the lead chick just puked all over during one of the performances because she was holding it in. For the longest time when I first got the feeling of needed to puke... I tried really hard to hold it in. I always want to be in control. I'm a firm believer in being the master of your own destiny and I'd classify myself as a control freak. But - there are things outside of your control and sometimes you gotta just let go. Fuck it. As they say.</p>
<p>I really struggled in vain to suppress my urge to vomit. I gotta say - I struggled valiantly. I stood over the toilet resisting the urge to vomit for probably over an hour. Then it felt like it just kept getting worse... and then I caved. I just gave up. If I was gonna vomit - might as well embrace it. I was probably sprawled over my toilet for another hour after that. Life was very very sucky. But the takeaway is that you gotta just accept things that will happen.</p>
<p>It was really weird because it felt like I was barely conscious during the whole ordeal. There was so much *autopilot* going on. Whenever I felt the urge to puke... I'd run towards the toilet before I even realized it - I'd be in front of the toilet. Habits and autopilot is weird like that.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - had to vomit. resisted in vain. let it go</strong></p>
