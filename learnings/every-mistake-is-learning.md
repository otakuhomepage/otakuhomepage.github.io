<p>I just made a $500 mistake. I went to see my dentist before my insurance coverage kicked in... I was off by one day. The mistake cost me $500. T_T</p>
<p>I was really annoyed yesterday when I first got the invoice because I was thinking of all the shit that I could buy with $500. And the mistake was really dumb, because I didn't check my insurance properly. I just started my new job September 2nd, and I figured insurance would kick in right away because that's how insurance is suppose to work. You get covered by your employer.</p>
<p>So when I randomly chipped my tooth mid September, I just scheduled the earliest possible dentist appointment. The dentist appointment was for September 30th. My coverage begins October 1st. blargh. fml fml fml.</p>
<p>This goes back to how important knowledge and knowing your shit matters. I remember how my grandparents had it rough because they couldn't speak english and they had to hire a lawyer to deal with an unfair eviction. I want to be a lawyer so that I know my rights and that people don't take advantage of me. Same thing with accounting and tax. It's so important to know the rules so that you don't make stupid mistakes.</p>
<p>Moral of the story - I got no one else to blame except myself. I made a $500 mistake but now I know. Insurance in America is retarded. Or rather, I'm retarded for believing in the system. You should always do your research and shit. Don't assume shit. It reminds me of the time when I assumed that the code would work properly. All actions should be independent of each other - it wasn't and shit went horribly wrong. Always read the code &#47; fine print so you don't get screwed over. Peace.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - don't guess. always check and make sure</strong></p>
