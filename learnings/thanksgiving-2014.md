<p>I read that being thankful and expressing gratitude is a huge part of happiness so this year I've decided to write down a list of things that I'm thankful for.</p>
<p>I'm thankful that I have my own place. I'm thankful that I live in San Francisco. I'm thankful for all the amazing people in my life. I'm thankful for all the people that I've met and interacted with and I can't wait to meet more people. I'm thankful that I always have food. I'm thankful that I'm generally in good health even though I'm still recovering from the flu. I'm thankful that I've gained a much better mindset. There's nothing that I can't handle. I'm thankful that I live in times of amazing technological progress. My Android tablet is faster and better than my Pentium IV from not that long ago. Tech is impressive. I'm thankful for all the amazing people that I get to work with at my current company. I am thankful that I live in a period of unlimited entertainment. There's never a shortage of film, music, media to keep me both entertained and growing. Great people decided to write books so that I could learn from them. I am thankful for how awesome I've become. I'm thankful for all the amazing experiences this year. Traveling to LA, Vancouver and all the exploring. I'm thankful that all the things that I want are available. The chocolate, snacks that I've always dreamed of gets delivered to my doorstep via amazon &#47; instacart. If there are things that I want but don't yet have - I'm thankful that I have the ability to obtain that which I desire.</p>
<p><strong>A diary of how I spent thanksgiving - Dinner at VIP with Stan. Chilling at Union Square after having food and snacks. Dodging 200 lightning bolts when I got home and completing Lulu's ultimate weapon. Bought Sennheiser 598 for $120 from amazon. Life is fucking awesome.</strong></p>
